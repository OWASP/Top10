## About OWASP

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is an open community dedicated to enabling organizations to develop, purchase, and maintain applications and APIs that can be trusted.

At OWASP you'll find free and open:

* Application security tools and standards
* Complete books on application security testing, secure code development, and secure code review
* Presentations and videos
* Cheat sheets on many common topics
* Standard security controls and libraries
* Local chapters worldwide
* Cutting edge research
* Extensive conferences worldwide
* Mailing lists

Learn more at: https://www.owasp.org.

All of the OWASP tools, documents, videos, presentations, and chapters are free and open to anyone interested in improving application security.

We advocate approaching application security as a people, process, and technology problem, because the most effective approaches to application security require improvements in these areas.

OWASP is a new kind of organization. Our freedom from commercial pressures allows us to provide unbiased, practical, cost-effective information about application security. OWASP is not affiliated with any technology company, although we support the informed use of commercial security technology. OWASP produces many types of materials in a collaborative, transparent and open way.

The OWASP Foundation is the non-profit entity that ensures the project's long-term success. Almost everyone associated with OWASP is a volunteer, including the OWASP Board, Chapter Leaders, Project Leaders, and project members. We support innovative security research with grants and infrastructure.

## Foreword

Insecure software is undermining our financial, healthcare, defense, energy, and other critical infrastructure. As our software becomes increasingly critical, complex, and connected, the difficulty of achieving application security increases exponentially. The rapid pace of modern software development processes makes risks even more critical to discover quickly and accurately. We can no longer afford to tolerate relatively simple security problems like those presented in this OWASP Top 10.

A great deal of feedback was received during the creation of the OWASP Top 10 2017, more than for any other equivalent OWASP effort. This shows how much passion the community has for the OWASP Top 10, and thus how critical it is for OWASP to get the Top 10 right for the majority of use cases.

Although the original goal of the OWASP Top 10 project was simply to raise awareness amongst developers, it has become the de facto application security standard. 

We have taken steps in this release to firm up the definition of issues, and improve the recommendations to be leading practices that may be adopted as an application security standard that covers off around 80-90% of all common attacks and threats. We encourage large and high performing organizations to use the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard if a true standard is required, but for most, the OWASP Top 10 is a great start on the application security journey.

We have written up a range of suggested next steps for different users of the OWASP Top 10, including "What's next for developers", "What's next for testers", "What's next for organizations" which is suitable for CIO's and CISO's, "What's next for application managers", which is suitable for application owners.

In the long term, we encourage all software development teams and organizations to create an application security program that is compatible with your culture and technology. These programs come in all shapes and sizes. Leverage your organization's existing strengths to do and measure what works for you.

We hope that the OWASP Top 10 is useful to your application security efforts. Please don't hesitate to contact OWASP with your questions, comments, and ideas at our GitHub project repository:

Lastly, we wish to thank the founding leadership of the OWASP Top 10 project, Dave Wichers and Jeff Williams for all their efforts, and believing in us to get this finished with the community's help. Thank you!
