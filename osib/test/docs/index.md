# Open Security Information Base (OSIB): Test Page

## Test Page based on OWASP Top 10: A01:2021 and A02:2021
<b>Please visit the original [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/Top10) for its latest version.</b>
On this test page some links to articles cannot be compiled by OSIB intentionally. This to show how the OSIB macros handle missing data in osib.yml.
Further logos and links to other Top 10 pages should not work on this demo.<br>
