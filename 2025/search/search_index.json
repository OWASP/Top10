We\u2019ve worked to maintain our focus on the root cause over the symptoms as much as possible. With the complexity of software engineering and software security, it\u2019s basically impossible to create ten categories without some level of overlap.</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>A01:2025 - Broken Access Control maintains its position at #1 as the most serious application security risk; the contributed data indicates that on average, 3.73% of applications tested had one or more of the 40 Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) in this category. As indicated by the dashed line in the above figure, Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) has been rolled into this category.</li> <li>A02:2025 - Security Misconfiguration moved up from #5 in 2021 to #2 in 2025. Misconfigurations are more prevalent in the data for this cycle. 3.00% of the applications tested had one or more of the 16 CWEs in this category. This is not surprising, as software engineering is continuing to increase the amount of an application\u2019s behavior that is based on configurations.</li> <li>A03:2025 - Software Supply Chain Failures is an expansion of A06:2021-Vulnerable and Outdated Components to include a broader scope of compromises occurring within or across the entire ecosystem of software dependencies, build systems, and distribution infrastructure. This category was overwhelmingly voted a top concern in the community survey. This category has 5 CWEs and a limited presence in the collected data, but we believe this is due to challenges in testing and hope that testing catches up in this area. This category has the fewest occurrences in the data, but also the highest average exploit and impact scores from CVEs.</li> <li>A04:2025 - Cryptographic Failures falls two spots from #2 to #4 in the ranking. The contributed data indicates that, on average, 3.80% of applications have one or more of the 32 CWEs in this category. This category often leads to sensitive data exposure or system compromise.</li> <li>A05:2025 - Injection falls two spots from #3 to #5 in the ranking, maintaining its position relative to Cryptographic Failures and Insecure Design. Injection is one of the most tested categories, with the greatest number of CVEs associated with the 38 CWEs in this category. Injection includes a range of issues from Cross-site Scripting (high frequency/low impact) to SQL Injection (low frequency/high impact) vulnerabilities.</li> <li>A06:2025 - Insecure Design slides two spots from #4 to #6 in the ranking as Security Misconfiguration and Software Supply Chain Failures leapfrog it. This category was introduced in 2021, and we have seen noticeable improvements in the industry related to threat modeling and a greater emphasis on secure design.</li> <li>A07:2025 - Authentication Failures maintains its position at #7 with a slight name change (prevously it was \u201cIdentification and Authentication Failures\") to more accurately reflect the 36 CWEs in this category. This category remains important, but the increased use of standardized frameworks for authentication appears to be having beneficial effects on the occurrences of authentication failures.</li> <li>A08:2025 - Software or Data Integrity Failures continues at #8 in the list. This category is focused on the failure to maintain trust boundaries and verify the integrity of software, code, and data artifacts at a lower level than Software Supply Chain Failures. </li> <li>A09:2025 - Security Logging &amp; Alerting Failures retains its position at #9. This category has a slight name change (previously Security Logging and Monitoring Failures\u201d) to emphasize the importance of the alerting functionality needed to induce appropriate action on relevant logging events. Great logging with no alerting is of minimal value in identifying security incidents. This category will always be underrepresented in the data, and was again voted into a position in the list from the community survey participants.</li> <li>A10:2025 - Mishandling of Exceptional Conditions is a new category for 2025. This category contains 24 CWEs focusing on improper error handling, logical errors, failing open, and other related scenarios stemming from abnormal conditions that systems may encounter.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"0x00_2025-Introduction/#methodology","title":"Methodology","text":"<p>This installment of the Top Ten remains data-informed, but not blindly data-driven. We ranked 12 categories based on the data contributed, and allowed two to be promoted or highlighted by responses from the community survey. We do this for a fundamental reason: examining the contributed data is essentially looking into the past. Application Security researchers dedicate time to identifying new vulnerabilities and developing new testing methods. It takes weeks to years to integrate these tests into tools and processes. By the time we can reliably test a weakness at scale, years may have passed. There are also important risks that we may never be able to reliably test and be present in the data. To balance that view, we use a community survey to ask application security and development practitioners on the front lines what they see as essential risks that may be underrepresented in the testing data.</p>"},{"location":"0x00_2025-Introduction/#how-the-categories-are-structured","title":"How the categories are structured","text":"<p>A few categories have changed from the previous installment of the OWASP Top Ten. Here is a high-level summary of the category changes.</p> <p>In this iteration, we asked for data, with no restriction on CWEs like we did for the 2021 edition. We asked for the number of applications tested for a given year (starting in 2021), and the number of applications with at least one instance of a CWE found in testing. This format allows us to track how prevalent each CWE is within the population of applications. We ignore frequency for our purposes; while it may be necessary for other situations, it only hides the actual prevalence in the application population. Whether an application has four instances of a CWE or 4,000 instances is not part of the calculation for the Top Ten. Especially as manual testers tend to only list a vulnerability once no matter how many times it is repeated in an application, while automated testing frameworks list every instance of a vulnerability as unique. We went from approximately 30 CWEs in 2017, to almost 400 CWEs in 2021, to 589 CWEs in this edition to analyze in the dataset. We plan to do additional data analysis as a supplement in the future. This significant increase in the number of CWEs necessitates changes to how the categories are structured.</p> <p>We spent several months grouping and categorizing CWEs and could have continued for additional months. We had to stop at some point. There are both root cause and symptom types of CWEs, where root cause types are like \"Cryptographic Failure\" and \"Misconfiguration\" contrasted to symptom types like \"Sensitive Data Exposure\" and \"Denial of Service.\" We decided to focus on the root cause whenever possible as it's more logical for providing identification and remediation guidance. Focusing on the root cause over the symptom isn't a new concept; the Top Ten has been a mix of symptom and root cause. CWEs are also a mix of symptom and root cause; we are simply being more deliberate about calling it out. There is an average of 25 CWEs per category in this installment, with the lower bounds at 5 CWEs for A03:2025-Software Supply Chain Failures and A09:2025 Security Logging and Alerting Failures to 40 CWEs in A01:2025-Broken Access Control. We made the decision to cap the number of CWEs in a category to 40. This updated category structure offers additional training benefits as companies can focus on CWEs that make sense for a language/framework. </p> <p>We have been asked why not shift to a list of 10 CWEs as a Top 10, similar to the MITRE Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Weaknesses. There are two primary reasons why we use multiple CWEs in categories. First, not all CWEs exist in all programming languages or frameworks. This causes issues for tooling and training/awareness programs as part of the Top Ten may not be applicable. The second reason is that there are multiple CWEs for common vulnerabilities. For example, there are multiple CWEs for general Injection, Command Injection, Cross-site Scripting, Hardcoded Passwords, Lack of Validation, Buffer Overflows, Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information, and many others. Depending on the organization or tester, different CWEs might be used. By using a category with multiple CWEs we can help raise the baseline and awareness of the different types of weaknesses that may occur under a common category name. In this edition of the Top Ten 2025, there are 248 CWEs within the 10 categories. There are a total of 968 CWEs in the downloadable dictionary from MITRE at the time of this release.</p>"},{"location":"0x00_2025-Introduction/#how-the-data-is-used-for-selecting-categories","title":"How the data is used for selecting categories","text":"<p>Similar to what we did for the 2021 edition, we leveraged CVE data for Exploitability and (Technical) Impact. We downloaded OWASP Dependency Check and extracted the CVSS Exploit and Impact scores, grouping them by relevant CWEs listed with the CVEs. It took a fair bit of research and effort, as all the CVEs have CVSSv2 scores, but there are flaws in CVSSv2 that CVSSv3 should address. After a certain point in time, all CVEs are assigned a CVSSv3 score as well. Additionally, the scoring ranges and formulas were updated between CVSSv2 and CVSSv3.</p> <p>In CVSSv2, both Exploit and (Technical) Impact could be up to 10.0, but the formula would knock them down to 60% for Exploit and 40% for Impact. In CVSSv3, the theoretical max was limited to 6.0 for Exploit and 4.0 for Impact. With the weighting considered, the Impact scoring shifted higher, almost a point and a half on average in CVSSv3, and exploitability moved nearly half a point lower on average.</p> <p>There are approximately 175k records (up from 125k in 2021) of CVEs mapped to CWEs in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), extracted from OWASP Dependency Check. Additionally, there are 643 unique CWEs mapped to CVEs (up from 241 in 2021). Within the nearly 220k CVEs that were extracted, 160k had CVSS v2 scores, 156k had CVSS v3 scores, and 6k had CVSS v4 scores. Many CVEs have multiple scores, which is why they total more than 220k.</p> <p>For the Top Ten 2025, we calculated average exploit and impact scores in the following manner. We grouped all the CVEs with CVSS scores by CWE and weighted both exploit and impact scores by the percentage of the population that had CVSSv3, as well as the remaining population with CVSSv2 scores, to get an overall average. We mapped these averages to the CWEs in the dataset to use as Exploit and (Technical) Impact scoring for the other half of the risk equation.</p> <p>Why not use CVSS v4.0, you may ask? That\u2019s because the scoring algorithm was fundamentally changed, and it no longer easily provides the Exploit or Impact scores as CVSS v2 and CVSSv3 do. We will attempt to figure out a way to use CVSS v4.0 scoring for future versions of the Top Ten, but we were unable to determine a timely way to do so for the 2025 edition.</p>"},{"location":"0x00_2025-Introduction/#why-we-use-a-community-survey","title":"Why we use a community survey","text":"<p>The results in the data are largely limited to what the industry can test for in an automated fashion.

Everything we find is looking back in the past and might be missing trends from the last year, which are not present in the data.</p> <p>Therefore, we only pick eight of the ten categories from the data because it's incomplete.

For 2025, we continued the same methodology that we created in 2021.</p> <p>We downloaded OWASP Dependency Check and extracted the CVSS Exploit, and Impact scores grouped by related CWEs.

However, this has not stopped organizations from using it as a de facto industry AppSec standard since its inception in 2003. If you want to use the OWASP Top 10 as a coding or testing standard, know that it is the bare minimum and just a starting point.</p> <p>One of the difficulties of using the OWASP Top 10 as a standard is that we document AppSec risks, and not necessarily easily testable issues. For example, A06:2025-Insecure Design is beyond the scope of most forms of testing. Another example is testing whether in-place, in-use, and effective logging and monitoring are implemented, which can only be done with interviews and requesting a sampling of effective incident responses. A static code analysis tool can look for the absence of logging, but it might be impossible to determine if business logic or access control is logging critical security breaches. Penetration testers may only be able to determine that they have invoked incident response in a test environment, which is rarely monitored in the same way as production.</p> <p>Here are our recommendations for when it is appropriate to use the OWASP Top 10:</p> Use Case OWASP Top 10 2025 OWASP Application Security Verification Standard Awareness     Yes     Training     Entry level     Comprehensive     Design and architecture     Occasionally     Yes     Coding standard     Bare minimum     Yes     Secure Code review     Bare minimum     Yes     Peer review checklist     Bare minimum     Yes     Unit testing     Occasionally     Yes     Integration testing     Occasionally     Yes     Penetration testing     Bare minimum     Yes     Tool support     Bare minimum     Yes     Secure Supply Chain     Occasionally     Yes     <p>We would encourage anyone wanting to adopt an application security standard to use the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS), as it\u2019s designed to be verifiable and tested, and can be used in all parts of a secure development lifecycle.</p> <p>The ASVS is the only acceptable choice for tool vendors. Tools cannot comprehensively detect, test, or protect against the OWASP Top 10 due to the nature of several of the OWASP Top 10 risks, with reference to A06:2025-Insecure Design.

More recently attackers have been found to \u2018increment\u2019 or otherwise adjust passwords, based on common human behavior. For instance, changing \u2018Winter2025\u2019 to \u2018Winter2026\u2019, or \u2018ILoveMyDog6\u2019 to \u2018ILoveMyDog7\u2019 or \u2018ILoveMyDog5\u2019. This adjusting of password attempts is called a hybrid credential stuffing attack or a password spray attack, and they can be even more effective than the traditional version. If an application does not implement defences against automated threats (brute force, scripts, or bots) or credential stuffing, the application can be used as a password oracle to determine if the credentials are valid and gain unauthorized access.</p> <p>Scenario #2: Most successful authentication attacks occur due to the continued use of passwords as the sole authentication factor. Once considered best practices, password rotation and complexity requirements encourage users to both reuse passwords and use weak passwords. Organizations are recommended to stop these practices per NIST 800-63 and to enforce use of multi-factor authentication on all important systems.</p> <p>Scenario #3: Application session timeouts aren't implemented correctly. A user uses a public computer to access an application and instead of selecting \"logout,\" the user simply closes the browser tab and walks away. Another Example for this is, if a Single Sign on (SSO) session can not be closed by a Single Logout (SLO). That is, a single login logs you into, for example, your mail reader, your document system, and your chat system. But logging out happens only to the current system. If an attacker uses the same browser after the victim thinks they have successfully logged out, but with the user still authenticated to some of the applications, then can access the victim's account. The same issue can happen in offices and enterprises when a sensitive application has not been properly exited and a colleague has (temporary) access to the unlocked computer.</p>"},{"location":"A07_2025-Authentication_Failures/#references","title":"References.","text":"<ul> <li> <p>OWASP Authentication Cheat Sheet</p> </li> <li> <p>OWASP Secure Coding Practices</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"A07_2025-Authentication_Failures/#list-of-mapped-cwes","title":"List of Mapped CWEs","text":"<ul> <li> <p>CWE-258 Empty Password in Configuration File</p> </li> <li> <p>CWE-259 Use of Hard-coded Password</p> </li> <li> <p>CWE-287 Improper Authentication</p> </li> <li> <p>CWE-288 Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel</p> </li> <li> <p>CWE-289 Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name</p> </li> <li> <p>CWE-290 Authentication Bypass by Spoofing</p> </li> <li> <p>CWE-291 Reliance on IP Address for Authentication</p> </li> <li> <p>CWE-293 Using Referer Field for Authentication</p> </li> <li> <p>CWE-294 Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay</p> </li> <li> <p>CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation</p> </li> <li> <p>CWE-297 Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch</p> </li> <li> <p>CWE-298 Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch</p> </li> <li> <p>CWE-299 Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch</p> </li> <li> <p>CWE-300 Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint</p> </li> <li> <p>CWE-302 Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data</p> </li> <li> <p>CWE-303 Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm</p> </li> <li> <p>CWE-304 Missing Critical Step in Authentication</p> </li> <li> <p>CWE-305 Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness</p> </li> <li> <p>CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function</p> </li> <li> <p>CWE-307 Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts</p> </li> <li> <p>CWE-308 Use of Single-factor Authentication</p> </li> <li> <p>CWE-309 Use of Password System for Primary Authentication</p> </li> <li> <p>CWE-346 Origin Validation Error</p> </li> <li> <p>CWE-350 Reliance on Reverse DNS Resolution for a Security-Critical Action</p> </li> <li> <p>CWE-384 Session Fixation</p> </li> <li> <p>CWE-521 Weak Password Requirements</p> </li> <li> <p>CWE-613 Insufficient Session Expiration</p> </li> <li> <p>CWE-620 Unverified Password Change</p> </li> <li> <p>CWE-640 Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password</p> </li> <li> <p>CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials</p> </li> <li> <p>CWE-940 Improper Verification of Source of a Communication Channel</p> </li> <li> <p>CWE-941 Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel</p> </li> <li> <p>CWE-1390 Weak Authentication</p> </li> <li> <p>CWE-1391 Use of Weak Credentials</p> </li> <li> <p>CWE-1392 Use of Default Credentials</p> </li> <li> <p>CWE-1393 Use of Default Password</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"A08_2025-Software_or_Data_Integrity_Failures/","title":"A08:2025 Software or Data Integrity Failures","text":""},{"location":"A08_2025-Software_or_Data_Integrity_Failures/#background","title":"Background.","text":"<p>Software or Data Integrity Failures continues at #8, with a slight, clarifying name change from \"Software and Data Integrity Failures\".

We must \u2018catch\u2019 every possible system error directly at the place where they occur and then handle it (which means do something meaningful to solve the problem and ensure we recover from the issue). As part of the handling, we should include throwing an error (to inform the user in an understandable way), logging of the event, as well as issuing an alert if we feel that is justified. We should also have a global exception handler in place in case there is ever something we have missed. Ideally, we would also have monitoring and/or observability tooling or functionality that watches for repeated errors or patterns that indicate an on-going attack, that could issue a response, defense, or blocking of some kind. This can help us block and respond to scripts and bots that focus on our error handling weaknesses.</p> <p>Catching and handling exceptional conditions ensures that the underlying infrastructure of our programs are not left to deal with unpredictable situations. If you are part way through a transaction of any kind, it is extremely important that you roll back every part of the transaction and start again (also known as failing closed). Attempting to recover a transaction part way through is often where we create unrecoverable mistakes.</p> <p>Whenever possible, add rate limiting, resource quotas, throttling, and other limits wherever possible, to prevent exceptional conditions in the first place. Nothing in information technology should be limitless, as this leads to a lack of application resilience, denial of service, successful brute force attacks, and extraordinary cloud bills. \\ Consider whether identical repeated errors, above a certain rate, should only be outputted as statistics showing how often they have occurred and in what time frame. This information should be appended to the original message so as not to interfere with automated logging and monitoring, see A09:2025 Security Logging &amp; Alerting Failures.</p> <p>On top of this, we would want to include strict input validation (with sanitization or escaping for potentially hazardous characters that we must accept), and centralized error handling, logging, monitoring, and alerting, and a global exception handler. One application should not multiple functions for handling exceptional conditions, it should be performed in one place, the same way each time. We should also create project security requirements for all the advice in this section, perform threat modelling and/or secure design review activities in the design phase of our projects, perform code review or static analysis, as well as execute stress, performance, and penetration testing of the final system.</p> <p>If possible, your entire organization should handle exceptional conditions in the same way, as it makes it easier to review and audit code for errors in this important security control.</p>"},{"location":"A10_2025-Mishandling_of_Exceptional_Conditions/#example-attack-scenarios","title":"Example attack scenarios.","text":"<p>Scenario #1: Resource exhaustion via mishandling of exceptional conditions (Denial of Service) could be caused if the application catches exceptions when files are uploaded, but doesn\u2019t properly release resources after.

If performing a full refactor, push for a rewrite in a memory-safe language when it is possible and feasible.</p> <p>If you are unable to use a memory-safe language, perform the following:</p> <ul> <li>Enable the following server features that make memory management errors harder to exploit: address space layout randomization (ASLR), Data Execution Protection (DEP), and Structured Exception Handling Overwrite Protection (SEHOP).</li> <li>Monitor your application for memory leaks.</li> <li>Validate all input to your system very carefully, and reject all input that does not meet expectations.</li> <li>Study the language you are using and make a list of unsafe and more-safe functions, then share that list with your entire team. If possible, add it to your secure coding guideline or standard. For example, in C, prefer strncpy() over strcpy() and strncat() over strcat().</li> <li>If your language or framework offers memory safety libraries, use them. For example: Safestringlib or SafeStr.</li> <li>Use managed buffers and strings rather than raw arrays and pointers whenever possible.</li> <li>Take secure coding training that focuses on memory issues and/or your language of choice.

In a successful attack, the overflow characters overwrite the stack pointer, allowing the attacker to insert malicious instructions into your program.</p> <p>Scenario #2: Use-After-Free (UAF) happens often enough that it\u2019s a semi-common browser bug bounty submission. Imagine a web browser processing JavaScript that manipulates DOM elements. The attacker crafts a JavaScript payload that creates an object (such as a DOM element) and obtains references to it. Through careful manipulation, they trigger the browser to free the object's memory while keeping a dangling pointer to it. Before the browser realizes the memory has been freed, the attacker allocates a new object that occupies the same memory space. When the browser tries to use the original pointer, it now points to attacker-controlled data. If this pointer was for a virtual function table, the attacker can redirect code execution to their payload. </p> <p>Scenario #3: A network service that accepts user input, doesn\u2019t properly validate or sanitize it, then passes it directly to the logging function. The input from the user is passed to the logging function as syslog(user_input) instead of syslog(\"%s\", user_input), which doesn\u2019t specify the format. The attacker sends malicious payloads containing format specifiers such as %x to read stack memory (sensitive data disclosure) or %n to write to memory addresses. By chaining together multiple format specifiers they could map out the stack, locate important addresses, and then overwrite them. This would be a Format string vulnerability (uncontrolled string format). </p> <p>Note: modern browsers use many levels of defenses to defend against such attacks, including browser sandboxing ASLR, DEP/NX, RELRO, and PIE. A memory management failure attack on a browser is not a simple attack to carry out.</p>"},{"location":"X01_2025-Next_Steps/#references_1","title":"References.","text":"<ul> <li>OWASP community pages: Memory leak, Doubly freeing memory, &amp; Buffer Overflow</li> <li>Awesome Fuzzing: a list of fuzzing resources </li> <li>Project Zero Blog</li> <li>Microsoft MSRC Blog</li> </ul>"},{"location":"X01_2025-Next_Steps/#list-of-mapped-cwes_1","title":"List of Mapped CWEs","text":"<ul> <li>CWE-14 Compiler Removal of Code to Clear Buffers</li> <li>CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer</li> <li>CWE-120 Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')</li> <li>CWE-121 Stack-based Buffer Overflow</li> <li>CWE-122 Heap-based Buffer Overflow</li> <li>CWE-124 Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')</li> <li>CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read</li> <li>CWE-126 Buffer Over-read</li> <li>CWE-190 Integer Overflow or Wraparound</li> <li>CWE-191 Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)</li> <li>CWE-196 Unsigned to Signed Conversion Error</li> <li>CWE-367 Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition</li> <li>CWE-415 Double Free</li> <li>CWE-416 Use After Free</li> <li>CWE-457 Use of Uninitialized Variable</li> <li>CWE-459 Incomplete Cleanup</li> <li>CWE-467 Use of sizeof() on a Pointer Type</li> <li>CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write</li> <li>CWE-788 Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer</li> <li>CWE-824 Access of Uninitialized Pointer</li> </ul>"},{"location":"X01_2025-Next_Steps/#x032025-inappropriate-trust-in-ai-generated-code-vibe-coding","title":"X03:2025 Inappropriate Trust in AI Generated Code ('Vibe Coding')","text":""},{"location":"X01_2025-Next_Steps/#background_2","title":"Background.","text":"<p>Currently the entire world is talking about and using AI, and this includes software developers.
