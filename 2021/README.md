# OWASP Top 10 2021

Final Release

## Building a local copy

Make sure Python 3 is installed.

```bash
# Build and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv ./venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Build HTML
mkdocs build
# Browse /2021/site
```

### Test it locally

Alternatively you can spin up a hot-reloading server:

```sh
make serve
```

Once you are happy, check in your changes as a branch / PR and let someone on the main team know. We'll review your changes, and merge and redeploy.

### Deploy to gh-pages

When the `master` branch is pushed, a Github Action will take care of everything and publish the website as a Github Page.

Alternatively `mkdocs` can be used to publish the website. This only works if you have commit privileges on master and Git is correctly setup in your environment.

```sh
cd 2021
mkdocs gh-deploy
```

gh-deploy works best if you have cloned the repository using ssh rather than https (which is the default for GitHub Desktop). Make sure you can authenticate to GitHub:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

If that works, gh-deploy will work as well.

### Translating the OWASP Top 10 2021

- Join the OWASP Slack and join the #top-10-translations channel. Let folks know what language you are doing. Someone might already be working on it.
- Fork and clone the Top 10 repo
- Follow the installation and local test instructions above
- Create a new branch for your language (something like 2021-fr)
- Add your translation to the plugin / navigation area in mkdocs.yml
- Test your translation locally by running a local server (see above)
- When you're ready, create a pull request against the OWASP Top 10 repo, and let us know it's ready for deployment
