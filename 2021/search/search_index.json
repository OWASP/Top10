THANK YOU!</p>"},{"location":"0x00_2021-introduction/#whats-changed-in-the-top-10-for-2021","title":"What's changed in the Top 10 for 2021","text":"<p>There are three new categories, four categories with naming and scoping changes, and some consolidation in the Top 10 for 2021. We've changed names when necessary to focus on the root cause over the symptom.</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>A01:2021-Broken Access Control moves up from the fifth position to the category with the most serious web application security risk; the contributed data indicates that on average, 3.81% of applications tested had one or more Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) with more than 318k occurrences of CWEs in this risk category. The 34 CWEs mapped to Broken Access Control had more occurrences in applications than any other category.</li> <li>A02:2021-Cryptographic Failures shifts up one position to #2, previously known as A3:2017-Sensitive Data Exposure, which was broad symptom rather than a root cause. The renewed name focuses on failures related to cryptography as it has been implicitly before. This category often leads to sensitive data exposure or system compromise.</li> <li>A03:2021-Injection slides down to the third position. 94% of the applications were tested for some form of injection with a max incidence rate of 19%, an average incidence rate of 3.37%, and the 33 CWEs mapped into this category have the second most occurrences in applications with 274k occurrences. Cross-site Scripting is now part of this category in this edition.</li> <li>A04:2021-Insecure Design is a new category for 2021, with a focus on risks related to design flaws. If we genuinely want to \"move left\" as an industry, we need more threat modeling, secure design patterns and principles, and reference architectures. An insecure design cannot be fixed by a perfect implementation as by definition, needed security controls were never created to defend against specific attacks.</li> <li>A05:2021-Security Misconfiguration moves up from #6 in the previous edition; 90% of applications were tested for some form of misconfiguration, with an average incidence rate of 4.5%, and over 208k occurrences of CWEs mapped to this risk category. With more shifts into highly configurable software, it's not surprising to see this category move up. The former category for A4:2017-XML External Entities (XXE) is now part of this risk category.</li> <li>A06:2021-Vulnerable and Outdated Components was previously titled Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities and is #2 in the Top 10 community survey, but also had enough data to make the Top 10 via data analysis. This category moves up from #9 in 2017 and is a known issue that we struggle to test and assess risk. It is the only category not to have any Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVEs) mapped to the included CWEs, so a default exploit and impact weights of 5.0 are factored into their scores.</li> <li>A07:2021-Identification and Authentication Failures was previously Broken Authentication and is sliding down from the second position, and now includes CWEs that are more related to identification failures. This category is still an integral part of the Top 10, but the increased availability of standardized frameworks seems to be helping.</li> <li>A08:2021-Software and Data Integrity Failures is a new category for 2021, focusing on making assumptions related to software updates, critical data, and CI/CD pipelines without verifying integrity. One of the highest weighted impacts from Common Vulnerability and Exposures/Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVE/CVSS) data mapped to the 10 CWEs in this category. A8:2017-Insecure Deserialization is now a part of this larger category.</li> <li>A09:2021-Security Logging and Monitoring Failures was previously A10:2017-Insufficient Logging &amp; Monitoring and is added from the Top 10 community survey (#3), moving up from #10 previously. This category is expanded to include more types of failures, is challenging to test for, and isn't well represented in the CVE/CVSS data. However, failures in this category can directly impact visibility, incident alerting, and forensics.</li> <li>A10:2021-Server-Side Request Forgery is added from the Top 10 community survey (#1). The data shows a relatively low incidence rate with above average testing coverage, along with above-average ratings for Exploit and Impact potential. This category represents the scenario where the security community members are telling us this is important, even though it's not illustrated in the data at this time.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"0x00_2021-introduction/#methodology","title":"Methodology","text":"<p>This installment of the Top 10 is more data-driven than ever but not blindly data-driven. We selected eight of the ten categories from contributed data and two categories from the Top 10 community survey at a high level. We do this for a fundamental reason, looking at the contributed data is looking into the past. AppSec researchers take time to find new vulnerabilities and new ways to test for them. It takes time to integrate these tests into tools and processes. By the time we can reliably test a weakness at scale, years have likely passed. To balance that view, we use a community survey to ask application security and development experts on the front lines what they see as essential weaknesses that the data may not show yet.</p> <p>There are a few critical changes that we adopted to continue to mature the Top 10.</p>"},{"location":"0x00_2021-introduction/#how-the-categories-are-structured","title":"How the categories are structured","text":"<p>A few categories have changed from the previous installment of the OWASP Top Ten. Here is a high-level summary of the category changes.</p> <p>Previous data collection efforts were focused on a prescribed subset of approximately 30 CWEs with a field asking for additional findings. We learned that organizations would primarily focus on just those 30 CWEs and rarely add additional CWEs that they saw. In this iteration, we opened it up and just asked for data, with no restriction on CWEs. We asked for the number of applications tested for a given year (starting in 2017), and the number of applications with at least one instance of a CWE found in testing. This format allows us to track how prevalent each CWE is within the population of applications. We ignore frequency for our purposes; while it may be necessary for other situations, it only hides the actual prevalence in the application population. Whether an application has four instances of a CWE or 4,000 instances is not part of the calculation for the Top 10. We went from approximately 30 CWEs to almost 400 CWEs to analyze in the dataset. We plan to do additional data analysis as a supplement in the future. This significant increase in the number of CWEs necessitates changes to how the categories are structured.</p> <p>We spent several months grouping and categorizing CWEs and could have continued for additional months. We had to stop at some point. There are both root cause and symptom types of CWEs, where root cause types are like \"Cryptographic Failure\" and \"Misconfiguration\" contrasted to symptom types like \"Sensitive Data Exposure\" and \"Denial of Service.\" We decided to focus on the root cause whenever possible as it's more logical for providing identification and remediation guidance. Focusing on the root cause over the symptom isn't a new concept; the Top Ten has been a mix of symptom and root cause. CWEs are also a mix of symptom and root cause; we are simply being more deliberate about it and calling it out. There is an average of 19.6 CWEs per category in this installment, with the lower bounds at 1 CWE for A10:2021-Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) to 40 CWEs in A04:2021-Insecure Design. This updated category structure offers additional training benefits as companies can focus on CWEs that make sense for a language/framework.</p>"},{"location":"0x00_2021-introduction/#how-the-data-is-used-for-selecting-categories","title":"How the data is used for selecting categories","text":"<p>In 2017, we selected categories by incidence rate to determine likelihood, then ranked them by team discussion based on decades of experience for Exploitability, Detectability (also likelihood), and Technical Impact. For 2021, we want to use data for Exploitability and (Technical) Impact if possible.</p> <p>We downloaded OWASP Dependency Check and extracted the CVSS Exploit, and Impact scores grouped by related CWEs. It took a fair bit of research and effort as all the CVEs have CVSSv2 scores, but there are flaws in CVSSv2 that CVSSv3 should address. After a certain point in time, all CVEs are assigned a CVSSv3 score as well. Additionally, the scoring ranges and formulas were updated between CVSSv2 and CVSSv3.</p> <p>In CVSSv2, both Exploit and (Technical) Impact could be up to 10.0, but the formula would knock them down to 60% for Exploit and 40% for Impact. In CVSSv3, the theoretical max was limited to 6.0 for Exploit and 4.0 for Impact. With the weighting considered, the Impact scoring shifted higher, almost a point and a half on average in CVSSv3, and exploitability moved nearly half a point lower on average.</p> <p>There are 125k records of a CVE mapped to a CWE in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) data extracted from OWASP Dependency Check, and there are 241 unique CWEs mapped to a CVE. 62k CWE maps have a CVSSv3 score, which is approximately half of the population in the data set.</p> <p>For the Top Ten 2021, we calculated average exploit and impact scores in the following manner. We grouped all the CVEs with CVSS scores by CWE and weighted both exploit and impact scored by the percentage of the population that had CVSSv3 + the remaining population of CVSSv2 scores to get an overall average. We mapped these averages to the CWEs in the dataset to use as Exploit and (Technical) Impact scoring for the other half of the risk equation.</p>"},{"location":"0x00_2021-introduction/#why-not-just-pure-statistical-data","title":"Why not just pure statistical data?","text":"<p>The results in the data are primarily limited to what we can test for in an automated fashion. Talk to a seasoned AppSec professional, and they will tell you about stuff they find and trends they see that aren't yet in the data. It takes time for people to develop testing methodologies for certain vulnerability types and then more time for those tests to be automated and run against a large population of applications. Everything we find is looking back in the past and might be missing trends from the last year, which are not present in the data.</p> <p>Therefore, we only pick eight of ten categories from the data because it's incomplete. The other two categories are from the Top 10 community survey. It allows the practitioners on the front lines to vote for what they see as the highest risks that might not be in the data (and may never be expressed in data).</p>"},{"location":"0x00_2021-introduction/#why-incidence-rate-instead-of-frequency","title":"Why incidence rate instead of frequency?","text":"<p>There are three primary sources of data. We identify them as Human-assisted Tooling (HaT), Tool-assisted Human (TaH), and raw Tooling.</p> <p>Tooling and HaT are high-frequency finding generators. Tools will look for specific vulnerabilities and tirelessly attempt to find every instance of that vulnerability and will generate high finding counts for some vulnerability types. Look at Cross-Site Scripting, which is typically one of two flavors: it's either a more minor, isolated mistake or a systemic issue. When it's a systemic issue, the finding counts can be in the thousands for a single application. This high frequency drowns out most other vulnerabilities found in reports or data.</p> <p>TaH, on the other hand, will find a broader range of vulnerability types but at a much lower frequency due to time constraints. When humans test an application and see something like Cross-Site Scripting, they will typically find three or four instances and stop. They can determine a systemic finding and write it up with a recommendation to fix on an application-wide scale. There is no need (or time) to find every instance.</p> <p>Suppose we take these two distinct data sets and try to merge them on frequency. In that case, the Tooling and HaT data will drown the more accurate (but broad) TaH data and is a good part of why something like Cross-Site Scripting has been so highly ranked in many lists when the impact is generally low to moderate. It's because of the sheer volume of findings. (Cross-Site Scripting is also reasonably easy to test for, so there are many more tests for it as well).</p> <p>In 2017, we introduced using incidence rate instead to take a fresh look at the data and cleanly merge Tooling and HaT data with TaH data. The incidence rate asks what percentage of the application population had at least one instance of a vulnerability type. We don't care if it was one-off or systemic. That's irrelevant for our purposes; we just need to know how many applications had at least one instance, which helps provide a clearer view of the testing is findings across multiple testing types without drowning the data in high-frequency results. This corresponds to a risk related view as an attacker needs only one instance to attack an application successfully via the category.</p>"},{"location":"0x00_2021-introduction/#what-is-your-data-collection-and-analysis-process","title":"What is your data collection and analysis process?","text":"<p>We formalized the OWASP Top 10 data collection process at the Open Security Summit in 2017.

Cryptographic vulnerabilities). Any decisions related to the raw data submitted are documented and published to be open and transparent with how we normalized the data.</p> <p>We look at the eight categories with the highest incidence rates for inclusion in the Top 10.

However, this has not stopped organizations from using it as a de facto industry AppSec standard since its inception in 2003. If you want to use the OWASP Top 10 as a coding or testing standard, know that it is the bare minimum and just a starting point.</p> <p>One of the difficulties of using the OWASP Top 10 as a standard is that we document AppSec risks, and not necessarily easily testable issues. For example, A04:2021-Insecure Design is beyond the scope of most forms of testing. Another example is testing whether in-place, in-use, and effective logging and monitoring are implemented, which can only be done with interviews and requesting a sampling of effective incident responses. A static code analysis tool can look for the absence of logging, but it might be impossible to determine if business logic or access control is logging critical security breaches. Penetration testers may only be able to determine that they have invoked incident response in a test environment, which is rarely monitored in the same way as production.</p> <p>Here are our recommendations for when it is appropriate to use the OWASP Top 10:</p> Use Case OWASP Top 10 2021 OWASP Application Security Verification Standard Awareness Yes Training Entry level Comprehensive Design and architecture Occasionally Yes Coding standard Bare minimum Yes Secure Code review Bare minimum Yes Peer review checklist Bare minimum Yes Unit testing Occasionally Yes Integration testing Occasionally Yes Penetration testing Bare minimum Yes Tool support Bare minimum Yes Secure Supply Chain Occasionally Yes <p>We would encourage anyone wanting to adopt an application security standard to use the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS), as it\u2019s designed to be verifiable and tested, and can be used in all parts of a secure development lifecycle.</p> <p>The ASVS is the only acceptable choice for tool vendors.

We've changed names when necessary to focus on the root cause over the symptom.</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>A01:2021-Broken Access Control moves up from the fifth position to the category with the most serious web application security risk; the contributed data indicates that on average, 3.81% of applications tested had one or more Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) with more than 318k occurrences of CWEs in this risk category. The 34 CWEs mapped to Broken Access Control had more occurrences in applications than any other category.</li> <li>A02:2021-Cryptographic Failures shifts up one position to #2, previously known as A3:2017-Sensitive Data Exposure, which was broad symptom rather than a root cause. The renewed name focuses on failures related to cryptography as it has been implicitly before. This category often leads to sensitive data exposure or system compromise.</li> <li>A03:2021-Injection slides down to the third position. 94% of the applications were tested for some form of injection with a max incidence rate of 19%, an average incidence rate of 3.37%, and the 33 CWEs mapped into this category have the second most occurrences in applications with 274k occurrences. Cross-site Scripting is now part of this category in this edition.</li> <li>A04:2021-Insecure Design is a new category for 2021, with a focus on risks related to design flaws. If we genuinely want to \"move left\" as an industry, we need more threat modeling, secure design patterns and principles, and reference architectures. An insecure design cannot be fixed by a perfect implementation as by definition, needed security controls were never created to defend against specific attacks.</li> <li>A05:2021-Security Misconfiguration moves up from #6 in the previous edition; 90% of applications were tested for some form of misconfiguration, with an average incidence rate of 4.5%, and over 208k occurrences of CWEs mapped to this risk category. With more shifts into highly configurable software, it's not surprising to see this category move up. The former category for A4:2017-XML External Entities (XXE) is now part of this risk category.</li> <li>A06:2021-Vulnerable and Outdated Components was previously titled Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities and is #2 in the Top 10 community survey, but also had enough data to make the Top 10 via data analysis. This category moves up from #9 in 2017 and is a known issue that we struggle to test and assess risk. It is the only category not to have any Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVEs) mapped to the included CWEs, so a default exploit and impact weights of 5.0 are factored into their scores.</li> <li>A07:2021-Identification and Authentication Failures was previously Broken Authentication and is sliding down from the second position, and now includes CWEs that are more related to identification failures. This category is still an integral part of the Top 10, but the increased availability of standardized frameworks seems to be helping.</li> <li>A08:2021-Software and Data Integrity Failures is a new category for 2021, focusing on making assumptions related to software updates, critical data, and CI/CD pipelines without verifying integrity. One of the highest weighted impacts from Common Vulnerability and Exposures/Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVE/CVSS) data mapped to the 10 CWEs in this category. A8:2017-Insecure Deserialization is now a part of this larger category.</li> <li>A09:2021-Security Logging and Monitoring Failures was previously A10:2017-Insufficient Logging &amp; Monitoring and is added from the Top 10 community survey (#3), moving up from #10 previously. This category is expanded to include more types of failures, is challenging to test for, and isn't well represented in the CVE/CVSS data. However, failures in this category can directly impact visibility, incident alerting, and forensics.</li> <li>A10:2021-Server-Side Request Forgery is added from the Top 10 community survey (#1). The data shows a relatively low incidence rate with above average testing coverage, along with above-average ratings for Exploit and Impact potential. This category represents the scenario where the security community members are telling us this is important, even though it's not illustrated in the data at this time.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"A00_2021_Introduction/#methodology","title":"Methodology","text":"<p>This installment of the Top 10 is more data-driven than ever but not blindly data-driven. We selected eight of the ten categories from contributed data and two categories from the Top 10 community survey at a high level. We do this for a fundamental reason, looking at the contributed data is looking into the past. AppSec researchers take time to find new vulnerabilities and new ways to test for them. It takes time to integrate these tests into tools and processes. By the time we can reliably test a weakness at scale, years have likely passed. To balance that view, we use a community survey to ask application security and development experts on the front lines what they see as essential weaknesses that the data may not show yet.</p> <p>There are a few critical changes that we adopted to continue to mature the Top 10.</p>"},{"location":"A00_2021_Introduction/#how-the-categories-are-structured","title":"How the categories are structured","text":"<p>A few categories have changed from the previous installment of the OWASP Top Ten. Here is a high-level summary of the category changes.</p> <p>Previous data collection efforts were focused on a prescribed subset of approximately 30 CWEs with a field asking for additional findings. We learned that organizations would primarily focus on just those 30 CWEs and rarely add additional CWEs that they saw. In this iteration, we opened it up and just asked for data, with no restriction on CWEs. We asked for the number of applications tested for a given year (starting in 2017), and the number of applications with at least one instance of a CWE found in testing. This format allows us to track how prevalent each CWE is within the population of applications. We ignore frequency for our purposes; while it may be necessary for other situations, it only hides the actual prevalence in the application population. Whether an application has four instances of a CWE or 4,000 instances is not part of the calculation for the Top 10. We went from approximately 30 CWEs to almost 400 CWEs to analyze in the dataset. We plan to do additional data analysis as a supplement in the future. This significant increase in the number of CWEs necessitates changes to how the categories are structured.</p> <p>We spent several months grouping and categorizing CWEs and could have continued for additional months. We had to stop at some point. There are both root cause and symptom types of CWEs, where root cause types are like \"Cryptographic Failure\" and \"Misconfiguration\" contrasted to symptom types like \"Sensitive Data Exposure\" and \"Denial of Service.\" We decided to focus on the root cause whenever possible as it's more logical for providing identification and remediation guidance. Focusing on the root cause over the symptom isn't a new concept; the Top Ten has been a mix of symptom and root cause. CWEs are also a mix of symptom and root cause; we are simply being more deliberate about it and calling it out. There is an average of 19.6 CWEs per category in this installment, with the lower bounds at 1 CWE for A10:2021-Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) to 40 CWEs in A04:2021-Insecure Design. This updated category structure offers additional training benefits as companies can focus on CWEs that make sense for a language/framework.</p>"},{"location":"A00_2021_Introduction/#how-the-data-is-used-for-selecting-categories","title":"How the data is used for selecting categories","text":"<p>In 2017, we selected categories by incidence rate to determine likelihood, then ranked them by team discussion based on decades of experience for Exploitability, Detectability (also likelihood), and Technical Impact. For 2021, we want to use data for Exploitability and (Technical) Impact if possible.</p> <p>We downloaded OWASP Dependency Check and extracted the CVSS Exploit, and Impact scores grouped by related CWEs. It took a fair bit of research and effort as all the CVEs have CVSSv2 scores, but there are flaws in CVSSv2 that CVSSv3 should address. After a certain point in time, all CVEs are assigned a CVSSv3 score as well. Additionally, the scoring ranges and formulas were updated between CVSSv2 and CVSSv3.</p> <p>In CVSSv2, both Exploit and (Technical) Impact could be up to 10.0, but the formula would knock them down to 60% for Exploit and 40% for Impact. In CVSSv3, the theoretical max was limited to 6.0 for Exploit and 4.0 for Impact. With the weighting considered, the Impact scoring shifted higher, almost a point and a half on average in CVSSv3, and exploitability moved nearly half a point lower on average.</p> <p>There are 125k records of a CVE mapped to a CWE in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) data extracted from OWASP Dependency Check, and there are 241 unique CWEs mapped to a CVE. 62k CWE maps have a CVSSv3 score, which is approximately half of the population in the data set.</p> <p>For the Top Ten 2021, we calculated average exploit and impact scores in the following manner. We grouped all the CVEs with CVSS scores by CWE and weighted both exploit and impact scored by the percentage of the population that had CVSSv3 + the remaining population of CVSSv2 scores to get an overall average. We mapped these averages to the CWEs in the dataset to use as Exploit and (Technical) Impact scoring for the other half of the risk equation.</p>"},{"location":"A00_2021_Introduction/#why-not-just-pure-statistical-data","title":"Why not just pure statistical data?","text":"<p>The results in the data are primarily limited to what we can test for in an automated fashion. Talk to a seasoned AppSec professional, and they will tell you about stuff they find and trends they see that aren't yet in the data. It takes time for people to develop testing methodologies for certain vulnerability types and then more time for those tests to be automated and run against a large population of applications. Everything we find is looking back in the past and might be missing trends from the last year, which are not present in the data.</p> <p>Therefore, we only pick eight of ten categories from the data because it's incomplete. The other two categories are from the Top 10 community survey. It allows the practitioners on the front lines to vote for what they see as the highest risks that might not be in the data (and may never be expressed in data).</p>"},{"location":"A00_2021_Introduction/#why-incidence-rate-instead-of-frequency","title":"Why incidence rate instead of frequency?","text":"<p>There are three primary sources of data. We identify them as Human-assisted Tooling (HaT), Tool-assisted Human (TaH), and raw Tooling.</p> <p>Tooling and HaT are high-frequency finding generators. Tools will look for specific vulnerabilities and tirelessly attempt to find every instance of that vulnerability and will generate high finding counts for some vulnerability types. Look at Cross-Site Scripting, which is typically one of two flavors: it's either a more minor, isolated mistake or a systemic issue. When it's a systemic issue, the finding counts can be in the thousands for a single application. This high frequency drowns out most other vulnerabilities found in reports or data.</p> <p>TaH, on the other hand, will find a broader range of vulnerability types but at a much lower frequency due to time constraints. When humans test an application and see something like Cross-Site Scripting, they will typically find three or four instances and stop. They can determine a systemic finding and write it up with a recommendation to fix on an application-wide scale. There is no need (or time) to find every instance.</p> <p>Suppose we take these two distinct data sets and try to merge them on frequency. In that case, the Tooling and HaT data will drown the more accurate (but broad) TaH data and is a good part of why something like Cross-Site Scripting has been so highly ranked in many lists when the impact is generally low to moderate. It's because of the sheer volume of findings. (Cross-Site Scripting is also reasonably easy to test for, so there are many more tests for it as well).</p> <p>In 2017, we introduced using incidence rate instead to take a fresh look at the data and cleanly merge Tooling and HaT data with TaH data. The incidence rate asks what percentage of the application population had at least one instance of a vulnerability type. We don't care if it was one-off or systemic. That's irrelevant for our purposes; we just need to know how many applications had at least one instance, which helps provide a clearer view of the testing is findings across multiple testing types without drowning the data in high-frequency results. This corresponds to a risk related view as an attacker needs only one instance to attack an application successfully via the category.</p>"},{"location":"A00_2021_Introduction/#what-is-your-data-collection-and-analysis-process","title":"What is your data collection and analysis process?","text":"<p>We formalized the OWASP Top 10 data collection process at the Open Security Summit in 2017.

Web applications tend to be written in managed     memory languages, such as Java, .NET, or node.js (JavaScript or     TypeScript). However, these languages are written in systems     languages that have memory management issues, such as buffer or heap     overflows, use after free, integer overflows, and more. There have     been many sandbox escapes over the years that prove that just     because the web application language is nominally memory \u201csafe,\u201d the     foundations are not.</p> </li> <li> <p>How to prevent. Many modern APIs are now written in memory-safe     languages such as Rust or Go. In the case of Rust, memory safety is     a crucial feature of the language. For existing code, the use of     strict compiler flags, strong typing, static code analysis, and fuzz     testing can be beneficial in identifying memory leaks, memory, and     array overruns, and more.</p> </li> <li> <p>Example attack scenarios. Buffer and heap overflows have been a     mainstay of attackers over the years. The attacker sends data to a program, which it stores in an undersized stack buffer. The result is that information on the call stack is overwritten, including the function\u2019s return pointer. The data sets the value of the return pointer so that when the function returns, it transfers control to malicious code contained in the attacker\u2019s data.</p> </li> <li> <p>References</p> <ul>

Wir haben bei Bedarf Namen ge\u00e4ndert, um uns auf die jeweilige Grundursache statt auf Symptome zu konzentrieren.</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>A01:2021-Mangelhafte Zugriffskontrolle steigt von der f\u00fcnften Position in die Kategorie mit dem schwerwiegendsten Sicherheitsrisiko f\u00fcr Webanwendungen auf. Die uns zur Verf\u00fcgung gestellten Daten zeigen, dass im Durchschnitt 3,81% der getesteten Anwendungen eine oder mehrere Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) dieser Kategorie aufweisen. Insgesamt wurden mehr als 318.000 CWEs in dieser Risikokategorie genannt. Die 34 CWE-Typen, die wir der 'mangelhaften Zugriffskontrolle' zuordneten, traten in Anwendungen h\u00e4ufiger auf, als die jeder anderen Kategorie.</li> <li>A02:2021-Fehlerhafter Einsatz von Kryptographie steigt mit neuem Namen um eine Position auf Nummer 2 auf. Bisher hie\u00df diese Kategorie A3:2017-Sensitive Data Exposure, was eher ein (allgemeines) Symptom, als die Grundursache war. Der neue Name fokussiert auf Fehler im Zusammenhang mit der Kryptographie, wie dies bereits implizit der Fall war. Diese Kategorie f\u00fchrt h\u00e4ufig zur Offenlegung vertraulicher Daten oder zur Kompromittierung des Systems.</li> <li>A03:2021-Injection steigt von der ersten auf die dritte Position ab. 94% der Anwendungen wurden auf eine Art von 'Injection' getestet, mit einer maximalen Inzidenzrate von 19% und einer durchschnittlichen Rate von 3,37%. Die 33 CWE-Typen dieser Kategorie weisen mit einem Vorkommen von insgesamt 274.000 Nennungen die zweith\u00e4ufigsten Vorf\u00e4lle bei Webanwendungen auf. 'Cross-Site Scripting' (XSS) wurde in dieser Ausgabe der Top 10 nun Teil dieser Kategorie.</li> <li>A04:2021-Unsicheres Anwendungsdesign ist eine neue Kategorie dieser Ausgabe, die sich mit Risiken im Zusammenhang mit Designfehlern bei Anwendungen besch\u00e4ftigt. Um die IT-Sicherheit fr\u00fcher im Software-Entwicklungsprozess zu ber\u00fccksichtigen, brauchen wir mehr Bedrohungsmodellierung, sichere Entwurfsmuster und -prinzipien sowie Referenzarchitekturen. Ein unsicheres Design kann nicht durch eine perfekte Implementierung behoben werden, da die erforderlichen Sicherheitsma\u00dfnahmen definitionsgem\u00e4\u00df nie zur Abwehr bestimmter Angriffe ber\u00fccksichtigt und implementiert wurden.</li> <li>A05:2021-Sicherheitsrelevante Fehlkonfiguration wechselt von Position 6 in der vorherigen Ausgabe einen Platz nach oben. 90% der Anwendungen wurden auf irgendeine Art von Fehlkonfiguration getestet, mit einer durchschnittlichen Inzidenzrate von 4,5% und \u00fcber 208.000 CWEs, die dieser Risikokategorie zugeordnet wurden. Angesichts der zunehmenden Verlagerung  zu hoch konfigurierbarer Software, ist es nicht verwunderlich, dass diese Kategorie aufsteigt. Die fr\u00fchere Kategorie f\u00fcr A4:2017-XML External Entities (XXE) ist jetzt auch Teil dieses Riikos.</li> <li>A06:2021-Unsichere oder veraltete Komponenten trug zuvor den Titel \"A9:2017-Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities\"  und ist Nr. 2 in der Top-10-Community-Umfrage, verf\u00fcgte jedoch \u00fcber gen\u00fcgend Nennungen in den gespendeten Daten, um es bereits dar\u00fcber in die Top 10 zu schaffen. Diese Kategorie steigt von Position 9 im Jahr 2017 auf Position 6 auf. Es handelt sich hierbei um ein bekanntes Problem, dessen Risiko wir nur schwer testen und bewerten k\u00f6nnen. Es ist die einzige Kategorie, bei der die zugeordneten CWEs von keiner 'Common Vulnerability and Exposure' (CVE) referenziert wird, sodass in ihren Bewertungen ein mittlerer Standard-Score von 5,0 f\u00fcr Exploit und in der Auswirkung ber\u00fccksichtigt werden.</li> <li>A07:2021-Fehlerhafte Authentifizierung f\u00e4llt von der zweiten Position auf Platz 7 zur\u00fcck. Das Risiko enth\u00e4lt jetzt CWEs, die eher mit Identifikationsfehlern zusammenh\u00e4ngen. Diese Kategorie ist immer noch ein fester Bestandteil der Top 10, aber die zunehmende Verf\u00fcgbarkeit standardisierter Frameworks scheint hier zu helfen.</li> <li>A08:2021-Fehlerhafte Pr\u00fcfung der Software- und Datenintegrit\u00e4t ist eine weitere, neue Kategorie f\u00fcr die Ausgabe von 2021, die sich auf Annahmen im Zusammenhang mit Software-Updates, kritischen Daten und CI/CD-Pipelines ohne \u00dcberpr\u00fcfung der Integrit\u00e4t befasst. Die 10 CWE-Typen dieser Kategorie werden von 'Common Vulnerability and Exposures' (CVEs) mit den h\u00f6chsten 'Common Vulnerability Scoring System' (CVSS)-Scores referenziert. A8:2017-Security Misconfiguration ist jetzt ein Teil dieser umfangreicher gewordenen Kategorie.</li> <li>A09:2021-Unzureichendes Logging und Sicherheitsmonitoring hie\u00df fr\u00fcher A10:2017-Insufficient Logging&amp;Monitoring, wurde auf Basis der Top-10-Community-Umfrage (Nr. 3) hinzugef\u00fcgt und r\u00fcckt von Platz 10 auf. Diese Kategorie wurde erweitert, um mehr Fehlertypen abzudecken, ist schwierig zu testen und ist in den CVE/CVSS-Daten nicht gut vertreten. Fehler in dieser Kategorie k\u00f6nnen sich jedoch direkt auf die Sichtbarkeit, Alarmierung bei Vorf\u00e4llen und Forensik der Anwendung auswirken.</li> <li>A10:2021-Server-Side Request Forgery wurde aus der Top-10-Community-Umfrage (Nr. 1) hinzugef\u00fcgt. Die Daten zeigen eine relativ niedrige Inzidenzrate bei einer \u00fcberdurchschnittlichen Testabdeckung sowie \u00fcberdurchschnittlichen Bewertungen f\u00fcr Exploit- und Impact-Potenzial. Diese Kategorie entspricht dem Szenario, bei dem die Mitglieder der Sicherheits-Community uns mitteilen, dass dies wichtig ist, auch wenn es in den Daten zu diesem Zeitpunkt nicht abgebildet wird.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"de/#methodik","title":"Methodik","text":"<p>Diese Ausgabe der Top 10 ist datengest\u00fctzter denn je, aber nicht mit blindem Vertrauen. Wir haben acht der zehn Kategorien aus den Datenbeitr\u00e4gen und zwei Kategorien aus der Experten-Umfrage in der OWASP-Community mit den h\u00f6chsten Bewertungen ausgew\u00e4hlt. Wir tun dies aus einer grunds\u00e4tzlichen, methodischen \u00dcberlegung: Der Blick auf die erhaltenen Daten ist ein Blick in die Vergangenheit. IT-Sicherheitsforschende nehmen sich Zeit, um neue Schwachstellen und neue M\u00f6glichkeiten zu finden, diese zu testen. Es braucht Zeit, diese Tests in Tools und Prozesse zu integrieren. Bis eine Schwachstelle in gro\u00dfem Ma\u00dfstab zuverl\u00e4ssig getestet wird, sind wahrscheinlich Jahre vergangen. Um diesen Umstand auszugleichen, nutzen wir eine Community-Umfrage, um Expertinnen und Experten f\u00fcr Anwendungssicherheit und Software-Entwicklung an vorderster Front zu befragen, was ihrer Meinung nach wesentliche Schwachstellen sind, die die Auswertung der Datenstatistik m\u00f6glicherweise noch nicht aufzeigt.</p> <p>Wir haben einige, wichtige \u00c4nderungen vorgenommen, um die Top 10 weiterzuentwickeln.</p>"},{"location":"de/#wie-die-kategorien-aufgebaut-sind","title":"Wie die Kategorien aufgebaut sind","text":"<p>Einige Kategorien haben sich gegen\u00fcber der vorherigen Ausgabe der OWASP Top Ten von 2017 ge\u00e4ndert. Im Folgenden finden Sie eine Zusammenfassung der \u00c4nderungen in den einzelnen Kategorien.</p> <p>Fr\u00fchere Datenerhebungen konzentrierten sich auf eine vorgegebene Teilmenge von etwa 30 CWE-Typen. In einem Freitextfeld wurde nach zus\u00e4tzlichen Erkenntnissen gefragt. Wir haben gelernt, dass sich Unternehmen in erster Linie auf diese 30 CWE-Typen konzentrieren und nur selten weitere CWEs erg\u00e4nzten, die sie gefunden hatten. In dieser Ausgabe haben wir das Verfahren ge\u00f6ffnet und nur nach Daten gefragt, ohne Einschr\u00e4nkung auf bestimmte CWE-Typen. Wir fragten nach der Anzahl der getesteten Anwendungen f\u00fcr ein bestimmtes Jahr (ab 2017) und nach der Anzahl der Anwendungen, bei denen mindestens ein CWE im Test gefunden wurde. Mit dieser Vorgehensweise k\u00f6nnen wir erkennen, wie oft die einzelnen CWE-Typen jeweils in den Anwendungen vorkommen. Wir ignorieren dabei f\u00fcr unsere Zwecke bewusst die H\u00e4ufigkeit von Schwachstellen je Anwendung. W\u00e4hrend es in anderen Situationen sinnvoll und notwendig sein kann, w\u00fcrde sie hier nur das tats\u00e4chliche Vorkommen in der Anwendungspopulation verschleiern. Ob in einer Anwendung ein CWE-Typ viermal vorkommt oder 4.000 Mal, ist f\u00fcr die Risikoberechnung der Top 10 nicht relevant. Durch dieses Vorgehen ist die Datenbasis von etwa 30 CWE-Typen auf fast 400 gestiegen, die wir f\u00fcr diese Ausgabe analysiert haben. Wir planen, in Zukunft weitere zus\u00e4tzliche Datenanalysen durchzuf\u00fchren. Dieser deutliche Anstieg der CWE-Typen erfordert \u00c4nderungen in der Strukturierung der Kategorien. </p> <p>Wir haben mehrere Monate damit verbracht, CWE-Typen zu gruppieren und zu kategorisieren, und h\u00e4tten noch weitere Monate damit fortfahren k\u00f6nnen. Irgendwann mussten wir zu einem Ergebnis kommen. Es gibt sowohl CWEs, die sich auf Grundursachen beziehen, als auch solche, die sich auf Symptome beziehen. Beispiele f\u00fcr Grundursache-Typen sind \u201eKryptografischer Fehler\u201c und \u201eFehlkonfiguration\u201c, f\u00fcr Symptomtypen k\u00f6nnen \u201eSensitive Data Exposure\u201c (Verlust der Vertraulichkeit sensibler Daten) und \u201eDenial of Service\u201c (mutwillige Dienstblockade) genannt werden. Wir haben uns entschieden, uns - wann immer m\u00f6glich - auf die Grundursache zu konzentrieren, da dies sinnvoller ist, um Hinweise zur Identifizierung und Behebung zu geben. Sich auf die Grundursache statt auf das Symptom zu konzentrieren, ist kein neues Konzept. Die Top Ten waren bisher eine Mischung aus Symptomen und Grundursachen. CWEs sind ebenfalls eine Mischung aus Symptomen und Grundursachen. Wir gehen einfach bewusster damit um und benennen sie.In dieser Version gibt es durchschnittlich 19,6 CWE-Typen pro Top10-Kategorie, wobei das Minimum bei 1 CWE f\u00fcr A10:2021-Server-Side Request Forgery und das Maximum bei 40 CWEs in A04:2021-Unsicheres Anwendungsdesign liegt.

Die weiteren Risikofaktoren Ausnutzbarkeit, Auffindbarkeit und technische Auswirkungen haben wir dann durch Teamdiskussionen basierend auf CVSS-Scores und jahrzehntelanger Erfahrung eingestuft. In 2021 wollten wir neben der, aus den aktuellen Daten abgeleiteten Verbreitung, nach M\u00f6glichkeit auch zur Einwertung der Faktoren Ausnutzbarkeit und (technische) Auswirkungen ausschlie\u00dflich Daten verwenden.</p> <p>Wir haben OWASP Dependency Check heruntergeladen, die CVSS-Exploit- und Impact-Scores extrahiert und sie nach den verwandten CWE-Typen gruppiert. Es war einiges an Recherche und Aufwand erforderlich, da zwar alle CVEs \u00fcber CVSSv2-Einwertungen verf\u00fcgen, bei den jedoch teilweise noch M\u00e4ngel vorhanden sind, die erst durch CVSSv3 beheben wurden. Ab einem bestimmten Zeitpunkt haben alle CVEs auch ein CVSSv3-Score erhalten. Dar\u00fcber hinaus wurden die Bewertungsskalen und Formeln zwischen CVSSv2 und CVSSv3 ver\u00e4ndert.</p> <p>In CVSSv2 konnten sowohl die Kategorie Exploit als auch (Technical) Impact Werte bis zu 10,0 betragen, aber die Formel w\u00fcrde sie auf 60% f\u00fcr Exploit und 40% f\u00fcr Impact begrenzen. In CVSSv3 ist das theoretische Maximum f\u00fcr Exploit auf 6,0 und f\u00fcr Impact auf 4,0 begrenzt. Unter Ber\u00fccksichtigung der Gewichtung in der Formel von CVSSv3 erh\u00f6hte sich der Einfluss der Impact-Bewertung, im Durchschnitt um fast eineinhalb Punkte, der f\u00fcr Exploit sank im Durchschnitt um fast einen halben Punkt.</p> <p>Im OWASP Dependency Check gibt es 125.000 Datens\u00e4tze der National Vulnerability Database (NVD) in der CVEs, einer CWE zugeordnet sind, und es gibt 241 CWEs, die mindestens einer CVE zugeordnet sind. 62.000 CWEs haben einen CVSSv3-Score, was in etwa der H\u00e4lfte des Datenbestands entspricht.</p> <p>F\u00fcr die Top Ten 2021 haben wir die durchschnittlichen Exploit- und Impact-Werte wie folgt berechnet.

Die Einzelwerte wurden normalisiert und zu einem Gesamt-Mittelwert zusammengefasst, der die Anzahl der jeweiligen CVSS-Bewertungen ber\u00fccksichtigt.

Wir bezeichnen sie als Human-Assisted Tooling (HaT), Tool-Assisted Human (TaH) und Raw Tooling.</p> <p>Raw Tooling und HaT sind Massen-Suchgeneratoren. Die Tools suchen nach bestimmten Schwachstellen und versuchen unerm\u00fcdlich, jedes Vorkommen dieser Schwachstelle zu finden. Dabei werden f\u00fcr einige Schwachstellentypen hohe Fundzahlen generiert. Bei Cross-Site Scripting gibt es in der Regel zwei Arten von Schwachstellen: Entweder handelt es sich um einen kleineren, isolierten Fehler oder um ein systemisches Problem. Wenn es sich um ein systemisches Problem handelt, kann die Zahl der Befunde bei einer einzigen Anwendung in die Tausende gehen. Diese hohe H\u00e4ufigkeit \u00fcbert\u00f6nt die meisten anderen, in Berichten oder in Daten gefundenen Schwachstellen.</p> <p>TaH hingegen wird ein breiteres Spektrum an Schwachstellentypen finden, diese jedoch aus Zeitgr\u00fcnden viel seltener. Wenn Menschen eine Anwendung testen und so etwas wie Cross-Site Scripting sehen, ermitteln sie normalerweise drei oder vier Vorkommen und brechen die weitere Suche dann ab. Sie k\u00f6nnen ein systemisches Problem erkennen und die Schwachstelle mit einer Empfehlung zur anwendungsweiten Behebung versehen. Es ist weder die Notwendigkeit noch die Zeit vorhanden, jedes (einzelne) Vorkommen zu finden.</p> <p>Angenommen, wir nehmen diese beiden unterschiedlichen Datens\u00e4tze und versuchen, sie nach H\u00e4ufigkeit zusammenzuf\u00fchren. In diesem Fall w\u00fcrden die Tooling- und HaT-Daten die genaueren (aber weit gefassten) TaH-Daten \u00fcbert\u00f6nen, und das ist ein guter Grund daf\u00fcr, warum etwas wie Cross-Site Scripting in vielen Listen so hoch eingestuft wird, obwohl die Auswirkungen im Allgemeinen gering bis moderat sind. Das liegt an der schieren Menge an Fundstellen (Cross-Site Scripting l\u00e4sst sich auch relativ einfach testen, daher gibt es auch viel mehr Tests daf\u00fcr).</p> <p>Im Jahr 2017 haben wir stattdessen die Verwendung der Inzidenzrate eingef\u00fchrt, um einen neuen Blick auf die Daten zu werfen und Raw Tooling- und HaT-Daten angemessen mit TaH-Daten zusammenzuf\u00fchren. Die Inzidenzrate bewertet, wie viele Prozent der Anwendungen mindestens ein Vorkommen eines Schwachstellentyps aufweist. Es ist uns egal, ob es einmalig oder systemisch war. Das ist f\u00fcr unsere Zwecke irrelevant. Wir m\u00fcssen lediglich wissen, wie viele Anwendungen mindestens ein Vorkommen hatte, was dazu beitr\u00e4gt, einen klareren \u00dcberblick \u00fcber die Testergebnisse \u00fcber mehrere, unterschiedliche Testtypen hinweg zu erhalten, ohne dass die Daten von Massen-Suchgeneratoren die Ergebnisse dominieren. Dies entspricht auch einer risikoorientierten Sichtweise, da Angreifende nur ein einziges Auftreten einer Schwachstelle ben\u00f6tigen, um eine Anwendung \u00fcber die Kategorie erfolgreich anzugreifen.</p>"},{"location":"de/#wie-sieht-ihr-datenerfassungs-und-analyseprozess-aus","title":"Wie sieht Ihr Datenerfassungs- und Analyseprozess aus?","text":"<p>Wir haben den OWASP-Top-10-Datenerfassungsprozess auf dem Open Security Summit 2017 formalisiert.

Penetrationstests werden m\u00f6glicherweise nur in einer Testumgebung stattfinden, die selten in der gleichen Weise wie die Produktion \u00fcberwacht ist, dabei ist es schwierig feststellen ob eine Reaktion auf die Vorf\u00e4lle ausgel\u00f6st wurde.</p> <p>Hier sind unsere Empfehlungen, wann es sinnvoll ist, die OWASP Top 10 zu verwenden:</p> Anwendungsfall OWASP Top 10 2021 OWASP Application Security Verification Standard Awareness ja Ausbildung Einstiegsniveau umfassend Design und Architektur gelegentlich ja Codierungsstandard als Mindestanforderung ja Security Code Review als  Mindestanforderung ja Checkliste f\u00fcr Peer-Reviews als Mindestanforderung ja Unit-Tests gelegentlich ja Integrationstests gelegentlich ja Penetrationstests als Mindestanforderung ja Werkzeugunterst\u00fctzung als Mindestanforderung ja Sichere Lieferkette gelegentlich ja <p>Wir empfehlen jedem, der einen Anwendungssicherheitsstandard \u00fcbernehmen m\u00f6chte, den OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) zu verwenden, da er entworfen wurde, um \u00fcberpr\u00fcfbar und testbar zu sein und in allen Teilen eines sicheren Entwicklungslebenszyklus verwendet werden kann.</p> <p>F\u00fcr Tool-Anbieter ist der ASVS die einzig akzeptable Wahl.

Wir haben bei Bedarf Namen ge\u00e4ndert, um uns auf die jeweilige Grundursache statt auf Symptome zu konzentrieren.</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>A01:2021-Mangelhafte Zugriffskontrolle steigt von der f\u00fcnften Position in die Kategorie mit dem schwerwiegendsten Sicherheitsrisiko f\u00fcr Webanwendungen auf. Die uns zur Verf\u00fcgung gestellten Daten zeigen, dass im Durchschnitt 3,81% der getesteten Anwendungen eine oder mehrere Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) dieser Kategorie aufweisen. Insgesamt wurden mehr als 318.000 CWEs in dieser Risikokategorie genannt. Die 34 CWE-Typen, die wir der 'mangelhaften Zugriffskontrolle' zuordneten, traten in Anwendungen h\u00e4ufiger auf, als die jeder anderen Kategorie.</li> <li>A02:2021-Fehlerhafter Einsatz von Kryptographie steigt mit neuem Namen um eine Position auf Nummer 2 auf. Bisher hie\u00df diese Kategorie A3:2017-Sensitive Data Exposure, was eher ein (allgemeines) Symptom, als die Grundursache war. Der neue Name fokussiert auf Fehler im Zusammenhang mit der Kryptographie, wie dies bereits implizit der Fall war. Diese Kategorie f\u00fchrt h\u00e4ufig zur Offenlegung vertraulicher Daten oder zur Kompromittierung des Systems.</li> <li>A03:2021-Injection steigt von der ersten auf die dritte Position ab. 94% der Anwendungen wurden auf eine Art von 'Injection' getestet, mit einer maximalen Inzidenzrate von 19% und einer durchschnittlichen Rate von 3,37%. Die 33 CWE-Typen dieser Kategorie weisen mit einem Vorkommen von insgesamt 274.000 Nennungen die zweith\u00e4ufigsten Vorf\u00e4lle bei Webanwendungen auf. 'Cross-Site Scripting' (XSS) wurde in dieser Ausgabe der Top 10 nun Teil dieser Kategorie.</li> <li>A04:2021-Unsicheres Anwendungsdesign ist eine neue Kategorie dieser Ausgabe, die sich mit Risiken im Zusammenhang mit Designfehlern bei Anwendungen besch\u00e4ftigt. Um die IT-Sicherheit fr\u00fcher im Software-Entwicklungsprozess zu ber\u00fccksichtigen, brauchen wir mehr Bedrohungsmodellierung, sichere Entwurfsmuster und -prinzipien sowie Referenzarchitekturen. Ein unsicheres Design kann nicht durch eine perfekte Implementierung behoben werden, da die erforderlichen Sicherheitsma\u00dfnahmen definitionsgem\u00e4\u00df nie zur Abwehr bestimmter Angriffe ber\u00fccksichtigt und implementiert wurden.</li> <li>A05:2021-Sicherheitsrelevante Fehlkonfiguration wechselt von Position 6 in der vorherigen Ausgabe einen Platz nach oben. 90% der Anwendungen wurden auf irgendeine Art von Fehlkonfiguration getestet, mit einer durchschnittlichen Inzidenzrate von 4,5% und \u00fcber 208.000 CWEs, die dieser Risikokategorie zugeordnet wurden. Angesichts der zunehmenden Verlagerung  zu hoch konfigurierbarer Software, ist es nicht verwunderlich, dass diese Kategorie aufsteigt. Die fr\u00fchere Kategorie f\u00fcr A4:2017-XML External Entities (XXE) ist jetzt auch Teil dieses Riikos.</li> <li>A06:2021-Unsichere oder veraltete Komponenten trug zuvor den Titel \"A9:2017-Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities\"  und ist Nr. 2 in der Top-10-Community-Umfrage, verf\u00fcgte jedoch \u00fcber gen\u00fcgend Nennungen in den gespendeten Daten, um es bereits dar\u00fcber in die Top 10 zu schaffen. Diese Kategorie steigt von Position 9 im Jahr 2017 auf Position 6 auf. Es handelt sich hierbei um ein bekanntes Problem, dessen Risiko wir nur schwer testen und bewerten k\u00f6nnen. Es ist die einzige Kategorie, bei der die zugeordneten CWEs von keiner 'Common Vulnerability and Exposure' (CVE) referenziert wird, sodass in ihren Bewertungen ein mittlerer Standard-Score von 5,0 f\u00fcr Exploit und in der Auswirkung ber\u00fccksichtigt werden.</li> <li>A07:2021-Fehlerhafte Authentifizierung f\u00e4llt von der zweiten Position auf Platz 7 zur\u00fcck. Das Risiko enth\u00e4lt jetzt CWEs, die eher mit Identifikationsfehlern zusammenh\u00e4ngen. Diese Kategorie ist immer noch ein fester Bestandteil der Top 10, aber die zunehmende Verf\u00fcgbarkeit standardisierter Frameworks scheint hier zu helfen.</li> <li>A08:2021-Fehlerhafte Pr\u00fcfung der Software- und Datenintegrit\u00e4t ist eine weitere, neue Kategorie f\u00fcr die Ausgabe von 2021, die sich auf Annahmen im Zusammenhang mit Software-Updates, kritischen Daten und CI/CD-Pipelines ohne \u00dcberpr\u00fcfung der Integrit\u00e4t befasst. Die 10 CWE-Typen dieser Kategorie werden von 'Common Vulnerability and Exposures' (CVEs) mit den h\u00f6chsten 'Common Vulnerability Scoring System' (CVSS)-Scores referenziert. A8:2017-Security Misconfiguration ist jetzt ein Teil dieser umfangreicher gewordenen Kategorie.</li> <li>A09:2021-Unzureichendes Logging und Sicherheitsmonitoring hie\u00df fr\u00fcher A10:2017-Insufficient Logging&amp;Monitoring, wurde auf Basis der Top-10-Community-Umfrage (Nr. 3) hinzugef\u00fcgt und r\u00fcckt von Platz 10 auf. Diese Kategorie wurde erweitert, um mehr Fehlertypen abzudecken, ist schwierig zu testen und ist in den CVE/CVSS-Daten nicht gut vertreten. Fehler in dieser Kategorie k\u00f6nnen sich jedoch direkt auf die Sichtbarkeit, Alarmierung bei Vorf\u00e4llen und Forensik der Anwendung auswirken.</li> <li>A10:2021-Server-Side Request Forgery wurde aus der Top-10-Community-Umfrage (Nr. 1) hinzugef\u00fcgt. Die Daten zeigen eine relativ niedrige Inzidenzrate bei einer \u00fcberdurchschnittlichen Testabdeckung sowie \u00fcberdurchschnittlichen Bewertungen f\u00fcr Exploit- und Impact-Potenzial.

Wir haben acht der zehn Kategorien aus den Datenbeitr\u00e4gen und zwei Kategorien aus der Experten-Umfrage in der OWASP-Community mit den h\u00f6chsten Bewertungen ausgew\u00e4hlt. Wir tun dies aus einer grunds\u00e4tzlichen, methodischen \u00dcberlegung: Der Blick auf die erhaltenen Daten ist ein Blick in die Vergangenheit. IT-Sicherheitsforschende nehmen sich Zeit, um neue Schwachstellen und neue M\u00f6glichkeiten zu finden, diese zu testen. Es braucht Zeit, diese Tests in Tools und Prozesse zu integrieren. Bis eine Schwachstelle in gro\u00dfem Ma\u00dfstab zuverl\u00e4ssig getestet wird, sind wahrscheinlich Jahre vergangen. Um diesen Umstand auszugleichen, nutzen wir eine Community-Umfrage, um Expertinnen und Experten f\u00fcr Anwendungssicherheit und Software-Entwicklung an vorderster Front zu befragen, was ihrer Meinung nach wesentliche Schwachstellen sind, die die Auswertung der Datenstatistik m\u00f6glicherweise noch nicht aufzeigt.</p> <p>Wir haben einige, wichtige \u00c4nderungen vorgenommen, um die Top 10 weiterzuentwickeln.</p>"},{"location":"de/A00_2021_Introduction/#wie-die-kategorien-aufgebaut-sind","title":"Wie die Kategorien aufgebaut sind","text":"<p>Einige Kategorien haben sich gegen\u00fcber der vorherigen Ausgabe der OWASP Top Ten von 2017 ge\u00e4ndert. Im Folgenden finden Sie eine Zusammenfassung der \u00c4nderungen in den einzelnen Kategorien.</p> <p>Fr\u00fchere Datenerhebungen konzentrierten sich auf eine vorgegebene Teilmenge von etwa 30 CWE-Typen. In einem Freitextfeld wurde nach zus\u00e4tzlichen Erkenntnissen gefragt. Wir haben gelernt, dass sich Unternehmen in erster Linie auf diese 30 CWE-Typen konzentrieren und nur selten weitere CWEs erg\u00e4nzten, die sie gefunden hatten. In dieser Ausgabe haben wir das Verfahren ge\u00f6ffnet und nur nach Daten gefragt, ohne Einschr\u00e4nkung auf bestimmte CWE-Typen. Wir fragten nach der Anzahl der getesteten Anwendungen f\u00fcr ein bestimmtes Jahr (ab 2017) und nach der Anzahl der Anwendungen, bei denen mindestens ein CWE im Test gefunden wurde. Mit dieser Vorgehensweise k\u00f6nnen wir erkennen, wie oft die einzelnen CWE-Typen jeweils in den Anwendungen vorkommen. Wir ignorieren dabei f\u00fcr unsere Zwecke bewusst die H\u00e4ufigkeit von Schwachstellen je Anwendung. W\u00e4hrend es in anderen Situationen sinnvoll und notwendig sein kann, w\u00fcrde sie hier nur das tats\u00e4chliche Vorkommen in der Anwendungspopulation verschleiern. Ob in einer Anwendung ein CWE-Typ viermal vorkommt oder 4.000 Mal, ist f\u00fcr die Risikoberechnung der Top 10 nicht relevant. Durch dieses Vorgehen ist die Datenbasis von etwa 30 CWE-Typen auf fast 400 gestiegen, die wir f\u00fcr diese Ausgabe analysiert haben. Wir planen, in Zukunft weitere zus\u00e4tzliche Datenanalysen durchzuf\u00fchren. Dieser deutliche Anstieg der CWE-Typen erfordert \u00c4nderungen in der Strukturierung der Kategorien. </p> <p>Wir haben mehrere Monate damit verbracht, CWE-Typen zu gruppieren und zu kategorisieren, und h\u00e4tten noch weitere Monate damit fortfahren k\u00f6nnen. Irgendwann mussten wir zu einem Ergebnis kommen. Es gibt sowohl CWEs, die sich auf Grundursachen beziehen, als auch solche, die sich auf Symptome beziehen. Beispiele f\u00fcr Grundursache-Typen sind \u201eKryptografischer Fehler\u201c und \u201eFehlkonfiguration\u201c, f\u00fcr Symptomtypen k\u00f6nnen \u201eSensitive Data Exposure\u201c (Verlust der Vertraulichkeit sensibler Daten) und \u201eDenial of Service\u201c (mutwillige Dienstblockade) genannt werden. Wir haben uns entschieden, uns - wann immer m\u00f6glich - auf die Grundursache zu konzentrieren, da dies sinnvoller ist, um Hinweise zur Identifizierung und Behebung zu geben. Sich auf die Grundursache statt auf das Symptom zu konzentrieren, ist kein neues Konzept. Die Top Ten waren bisher eine Mischung aus Symptomen und Grundursachen. CWEs sind ebenfalls eine Mischung aus Symptomen und Grundursachen. Wir gehen einfach bewusster damit um und benennen sie.In dieser Version gibt es durchschnittlich 19,6 CWE-Typen pro Top10-Kategorie, wobei das Minimum bei 1 CWE f\u00fcr A10:2021-Server-Side Request Forgery und das Maximum bei 40 CWEs in A04:2021-Unsicheres Anwendungsdesign liegt.

Die weiteren Risikofaktoren Ausnutzbarkeit, Auffindbarkeit und technische Auswirkungen haben wir dann durch Teamdiskussionen basierend auf CVSS-Scores und jahrzehntelanger Erfahrung eingestuft. In 2021 wollten wir neben der, aus den aktuellen Daten abgeleiteten Verbreitung, nach M\u00f6glichkeit auch zur Einwertung der Faktoren Ausnutzbarkeit und (technische) Auswirkungen ausschlie\u00dflich Daten verwenden.</p> <p>Wir haben OWASP Dependency Check heruntergeladen, die CVSS-Exploit- und Impact-Scores extrahiert und sie nach den verwandten CWE-Typen gruppiert. Es war einiges an Recherche und Aufwand erforderlich, da zwar alle CVEs \u00fcber CVSSv2-Einwertungen verf\u00fcgen, bei den jedoch teilweise noch M\u00e4ngel vorhanden sind, die erst durch CVSSv3 beheben wurden. Ab einem bestimmten Zeitpunkt haben alle CVEs auch ein CVSSv3-Score erhalten. Dar\u00fcber hinaus wurden die Bewertungsskalen und Formeln zwischen CVSSv2 und CVSSv3 ver\u00e4ndert.</p> <p>In CVSSv2 konnten sowohl die Kategorie Exploit als auch (Technical) Impact Werte bis zu 10,0 betragen, aber die Formel w\u00fcrde sie auf 60% f\u00fcr Exploit und 40% f\u00fcr Impact begrenzen. In CVSSv3 ist das theoretische Maximum f\u00fcr Exploit auf 6,0 und f\u00fcr Impact auf 4,0 begrenzt. Unter Ber\u00fccksichtigung der Gewichtung in der Formel von CVSSv3 erh\u00f6hte sich der Einfluss der Impact-Bewertung, im Durchschnitt um fast eineinhalb Punkte, der f\u00fcr Exploit sank im Durchschnitt um fast einen halben Punkt.</p> <p>Im OWASP Dependency Check gibt es 125.000 Datens\u00e4tze der National Vulnerability Database (NVD) in der CVEs, einer CWE zugeordnet sind, und es gibt 241 CWEs, die mindestens einer CVE zugeordnet sind. 62.000 CWEs haben einen CVSSv3-Score, was in etwa der H\u00e4lfte des Datenbestands entspricht.</p> <p>F\u00fcr die Top Ten 2021 haben wir die durchschnittlichen Exploit- und Impact-Werte wie folgt berechnet.

Die Einzelwerte wurden normalisiert und zu einem Gesamt-Mittelwert zusammengefasst, der die Anzahl der jeweiligen CVSS-Bewertungen ber\u00fccksichtigt.

Wir bezeichnen sie als Human-Assisted Tooling (HaT), Tool-Assisted Human (TaH) und Raw Tooling.</p> <p>Raw Tooling und HaT sind Massen-Suchgeneratoren. Die Tools suchen nach bestimmten Schwachstellen und versuchen unerm\u00fcdlich, jedes Vorkommen dieser Schwachstelle zu finden. Dabei werden f\u00fcr einige Schwachstellentypen hohe Fundzahlen generiert. Bei Cross-Site Scripting gibt es in der Regel zwei Arten von Schwachstellen: Entweder handelt es sich um einen kleineren, isolierten Fehler oder um ein systemisches Problem. Wenn es sich um ein systemisches Problem handelt, kann die Zahl der Befunde bei einer einzigen Anwendung in die Tausende gehen. Diese hohe H\u00e4ufigkeit \u00fcbert\u00f6nt die meisten anderen, in Berichten oder in Daten gefundenen Schwachstellen.</p> <p>TaH hingegen wird ein breiteres Spektrum an Schwachstellentypen finden, diese jedoch aus Zeitgr\u00fcnden viel seltener. Wenn Menschen eine Anwendung testen und so etwas wie Cross-Site Scripting sehen, ermitteln sie normalerweise drei oder vier Vorkommen und brechen die weitere Suche dann ab. Sie k\u00f6nnen ein systemisches Problem erkennen und die Schwachstelle mit einer Empfehlung zur anwendungsweiten Behebung versehen. Es ist weder die Notwendigkeit noch die Zeit vorhanden, jedes (einzelne) Vorkommen zu finden.</p> <p>Angenommen, wir nehmen diese beiden unterschiedlichen Datens\u00e4tze und versuchen, sie nach H\u00e4ufigkeit zusammenzuf\u00fchren. In diesem Fall w\u00fcrden die Tooling- und HaT-Daten die genaueren (aber weit gefassten) TaH-Daten \u00fcbert\u00f6nen, und das ist ein guter Grund daf\u00fcr, warum etwas wie Cross-Site Scripting in vielen Listen so hoch eingestuft wird, obwohl die Auswirkungen im Allgemeinen gering bis moderat sind. Das liegt an der schieren Menge an Fundstellen (Cross-Site Scripting l\u00e4sst sich auch relativ einfach testen, daher gibt es auch viel mehr Tests daf\u00fcr).</p> <p>Im Jahr 2017 haben wir stattdessen die Verwendung der Inzidenzrate eingef\u00fchrt, um einen neuen Blick auf die Daten zu werfen und Raw Tooling- und HaT-Daten angemessen mit TaH-Daten zusammenzuf\u00fchren.

Hacemos esto por una raz\u00f3n fundamental, mirar los datos aportados es mirar al pasado. Los investigadores de seguridad en aplicaciones se toman su tiempo para encontrar nuevas vulnerabilidades y nuevas formas de probarlas. Se necesita tiempo para integrar estas pruebas en las herramientas y los procesos. Para el momento en que podamos probar de forma fiable una vulnerabilidad a escala, es probable que hayan pasado a\u00f1os. Para compensar este punto de vista, utilizamos una encuesta de la comunidad en la que preguntamos a los expertos en seguridad y desarrollo de aplicaciones que se encuentran en primera l\u00ednea cu\u00e1les son, en su opini\u00f3n, las vulnerabilidades esenciales que los datos a\u00fan no muestran.</p> <p>Hay algunos cambios cr\u00edticos que hemos adoptado para seguir madurando el Top 10.</p>"},{"location":"es/#como-se-estructuran-las-categorias","title":"C\u00f3mo se estructuran las categor\u00edas","text":"<p>Algunas categor\u00edas han cambiado con respecto a la anterior entrega del OWASP Top Ten. A continuaci\u00f3n se presenta un resumen de alto nivel de los cambios de categor\u00eda.</p> <p>Los trabajos anteriores de recopilaci\u00f3n de datos se centraban en un subconjunto prescrito de aproximadamente 30 CWEs, con un campo que solicitaba hallazgos adicionales. Nos dimos cuenta de que las organizaciones se centraban principalmente en esas 30 CWEs y rara vez a\u00f1ad\u00edan otras CWEs que ve\u00edan. En esta iteraci\u00f3n, lo abrimos y solo pedimos datos, sin ninguna restricci\u00f3n sobre las CWEs. Solicitamos el n\u00famero de aplicaciones analizadas para un a\u00f1o determinado (a partir de 2017) y el n\u00famero de aplicaciones con al menos una instancia de una CWE encontrada en las pruebas. Este formato nos permite rastrear la prevalencia de cada CWE dentro de la poblaci\u00f3n de aplicaciones. Ignoramos la frecuencia para nuestros prop\u00f3sitos; aunque puede ser necesaria para otras situaciones, solo oculta la prevalencia real en la poblaci\u00f3n de aplicaciones. El hecho de que una aplicaci\u00f3n tenga cuatro instancias de una CWE o 4.000 instancias no forma parte del c\u00e1lculo para el Top 10. Hemos pasado de aproximadamente 30 CWEs a casi 400 CWEs para analizar en el conjunto de datos. Tenemos previsto realizar an\u00e1lisis de datos adicionales como complemento en el futuro. Este aumento significativo en el n\u00famero de CWEs hace necesario cambiar la estructura de las categor\u00edas.</p> <p>Pasamos varios meses agrupando y clasificando las CWEs y podr\u00edamos haber seguido durante m\u00e1s tiempo. En alg\u00fan momento tuvimos que parar. Hay tipos de CWE de causa ra\u00edz y de s\u00edntoma, donde los de causa ra\u00edz ser\u00edan \"Falla Criptogr\u00e1fica\" y \"Configuraci\u00f3n de Seguridad Incorrecta\" en contraste con los de s\u00edntoma como \"Exposici\u00f3n de Datos Sensibles\" y \"Denegaci\u00f3n de Servicio\". Hemos decidido centrarnos en la causa ra\u00edz siempre que sea posible, ya que es m\u00e1s l\u00f3gico para proporcionar orientaci\u00f3n sobre la identificaci\u00f3n y la reparaci\u00f3n. Centrarse en la causa ra\u00edz en lugar de en el s\u00edntoma no es un concepto nuevo; el Top Ten ha sido una mezcla de s\u00edntoma y causa ra\u00edz. Las CWEs tambi\u00e9n son una mezcla de s\u00edntoma y causa ra\u00edz; simplemente estamos siendo m\u00e1s expl\u00edcitos al respecto y lo se\u00f1alamos. Hay un promedio de 19,6 CWEs por categor\u00eda en esta entrega, con el l\u00edmite inferior de 1 CWE para A10:2021-Falsificaci\u00f3n de Solicitudes del Lado del Servidor (SSRF) a 40 CWEs en A04:2021-Dise\u00f1o Inseguro.

Las identificamos como Herramienta asistida por Humanos (HaT), Humano asistido por Herramientas (TaH) y Herramientas en bruto.</p> <p>Herramientas y HaT son generadores de hallazgos de alta frecuencia. Las herramientas buscar\u00e1n vulnerabilidades espec\u00edficas e intentar\u00e1n incansablemente encontrar cada instancia de esa vulnerabilidad y generar\u00e1n un elevado n\u00famero de hallazgos para algunos tipos de vulnerabilidades. Por ejemplo, el Cross-Site Scripting, suele ser de dos tipos: o bien es un error menor y aislado, o bien es un problema sist\u00e9mico. Cuando se trata de un problema sist\u00e9mico, el n\u00famero de hallazgos puede ser de miles para una sola aplicaci\u00f3n. Esta alta frecuencia ahoga a la mayor\u00eda de las dem\u00e1s vulnerabilidades encontradas en los informes o datos.</p> <p>Por otro lado, TaH encontrar\u00e1 una gama m\u00e1s amplia de tipos de vulnerabilidades, pero con una frecuencia mucho menor debido a las limitaciones de tiempo. Cuando los humanos prueban una aplicaci\u00f3n y ven algo como un Cross-Site Scripting, normalmente encontrar\u00e1n tres o cuatro instancias y se detendr\u00e1n. Pueden determinar un hallazgo sist\u00e9mico y escribir una recomendaci\u00f3n para corregirlo a gran escala en la aplicaci\u00f3n. No hay necesidad (ni tiempo) de encontrar cada instancia.</p> <p>Supongamos que tomamos estos dos conjuntos de datos distintos y tratamos de fusionarlos por su frecuencia. En ese caso, los datos de Herramientas y HaT ahogar\u00e1n los datos m\u00e1s precisos (aunque amplios) de TaH y es en buena parte la raz\u00f3n por la que algo como el Cross-Site Scripting ha sido clasificado tan alto en muchas listas cuando el impacto es generalmente bajo o moderado. Se debe al gran volumen de hallazgos. (El Cross-Site Scripting es adem\u00e1s razonablemente f\u00e1cil de probar, por lo que hay muchas m\u00e1s pruebas para ello).</p> <p>En 2017, introdujimos el uso de la tasa de incidencia en su lugar para dar una nueva mirada a los datos y combinar de manera transparente los datos de Herramientas y HaT con los datos de TaH. La tasa de incidencia se refiere al porcentaje de la poblaci\u00f3n de aplicaciones que tiene al menos una instancia de un tipo de vulnerabilidad. No nos importa si fue algo puntual o sist\u00e9mico. Eso es irrelevante para nuestros objetivos; solo necesitamos saber cu\u00e1ntas aplicaciones ten\u00edan al menos una instancia, lo cual ayuda a proporcionar una visi\u00f3n m\u00e1s clara de los hallazgos de las pruebas a trav\u00e9s de m\u00faltiples tipos de pruebas sin ahogar los datos en resultados de alta frecuencia. Esto corresponde a una visi\u00f3n relacionada con el riesgo, ya que un atacante solo necesita una instancia para atacar una aplicaci\u00f3n con \u00e9xito a trav\u00e9s de dicha categor\u00eda.</p>"},{"location":"es/#cual-es-su-proceso-de-recopilacion-y-analisis-de-datos","title":"\u00bfCu\u00e1l es su proceso de recopilaci\u00f3n y an\u00e1lisis de datos?","text":"<p>En el Open Security Summit de 2017 formalizamos el proceso de recopilaci\u00f3n de datos del OWASP Top 10.

Nos dimos cuenta de que las organizaciones se centraban principalmente en esas 30 CWEs y rara vez a\u00f1ad\u00edan otras CWEs que ve\u00edan. En esta iteraci\u00f3n, lo abrimos y solo pedimos datos, sin ninguna restricci\u00f3n sobre las CWEs. Solicitamos el n\u00famero de aplicaciones analizadas para un a\u00f1o determinado (a partir de 2017) y el n\u00famero de aplicaciones con al menos una instancia de una CWE encontrada en las pruebas. Este formato nos permite rastrear la prevalencia de cada CWE dentro de la poblaci\u00f3n de aplicaciones. Ignoramos la frecuencia para nuestros prop\u00f3sitos; aunque puede ser necesaria para otras situaciones, solo oculta la prevalencia real en la poblaci\u00f3n de aplicaciones. El hecho de que una aplicaci\u00f3n tenga cuatro instancias de una CWE o 4.000 instancias, no forma parte del c\u00e1lculo para el Top 10. Hemos pasado de aproximadamente 30 a casi 400 CWEs para analizar en el conjunto de datos. Tenemos previsto realizar an\u00e1lisis de datos adicionales como complemento en el futuro.

Hemos decidido centrarnos en la causa ra\u00edz siempre que sea posible, ya que es m\u00e1s l\u00f3gico para proporcionar orientaci\u00f3n sobre la identificaci\u00f3n y la remediaci\u00f3n. Centrarse en la causa ra\u00edz en lugar de en el s\u00edntoma no es un concepto nuevo; el Top 10 ha sido una mezcla de s\u00edntoma y causa ra\u00edz. Las CWEs tambi\u00e9n son una mezcla de s\u00edntoma y causa ra\u00edz; simplemente estamos siendo m\u00e1s expl\u00edcitos al respecto y lo se\u00f1alamos.

La tasa de incidencia se refiere al porcentaje de la poblaci\u00f3n de aplicaciones que tiene al menos una instancia de un tipo de vulnerabilidad. No nos importa si fue algo puntual o sist\u00e9mico. Eso es irrelevante para nuestros objetivos, solo necesitamos saber cu\u00e1ntas aplicaciones ten\u00edan al menos una instancia, lo cual ayuda a proporcionar una visi\u00f3n m\u00e1s clara de los hallazgos de las pruebas a trav\u00e9s de m\u00faltiples tipos de pruebas sin enmascarar los datos en resultados de alta frecuencia.

Nous avons appris que les organisations se concentraient sur les seules 30 CWEs et n'ajoutaient que rarement d'autres CWEs qu'elles rencontraient. Dans cette \u00e9dition, nous nous sommes content\u00e9s de demander des donn\u00e9es, sans aucune restriction sur les CWEs. Nous avons demand\u00e9 le nombre d'applications test\u00e9es pour une ann\u00e9e donn\u00e9e (\u00e0 partir de 2017), et le nombre d'applications avec au moins une instance d'une CWE trouv\u00e9e lors des tests. Ce format nous permet de d\u00e9terminer la pr\u00e9valence de chaque CWE au sein des applications. Nous ignorons la fr\u00e9quence pour nos besoins ; bien que cela pourrait \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaire dans d'autres situations, cela cache la pr\u00e9valence au sein du panel. Qu'une application ait quatre instances d'une CWE ou 4 000 ne fait pas partie du calcul du Top 10. Nous sommes pass\u00e9s d'approximativement 30 CWEs \u00e0 pr\u00e8s de 400 CWEs \u00e0 analyser dans le jeu de donn\u00e9es. Nous pr\u00e9voyons d'ajouter des analyses compl\u00e9mentaires dans le futur. Cette augmentation significative dans le nombre de CWEs n\u00e9cessite des changements dans la fa\u00e7on dont les cat\u00e9gories sont structur\u00e9es.</p> <p>Nous avons pass\u00e9 plusieurs mois \u00e0 regrouper et cat\u00e9goriser les CWEs. Nous aurions pu continuer encore pendant des mois. Nous avons d\u00fb nous arr\u00eater \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9. Il existe \u00e0 la fois des CWEs de type cause racine et sympt\u00f4me, o\u00f9 les types cause racine sont de la forme \"D\u00e9faillances cryptographiques\" et \"Mauvaise configuration\", en contraste avec les types sympt\u00f4me tels que \"Exposition de donn\u00e9es sensibles\" et \"D\u00e9ni de service\". Nous avons d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de nous concentrer sur les types cause racine autant que possible car ils sont plus logiques pour fournir des conseils d'identification et de rem\u00e9diation. Se concentrer sur la cause racine plut\u00f4t que le sympt\u00f4me n'est pas un concept nouveau ; le Top 10 a \u00e9t\u00e9 un m\u00e9lange de sympt\u00f4mes et de causes racines. Les CWEs le sont \u00e9galement ; nous faisons ce choix d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment et lan\u00e7ons un appel \u00e0 ce sujet. Il y a une moyenne de 19,6 CWEs par cat\u00e9gorie dans cette \u00e9dition, avec un minimum d'1 CWE pour A10:2021-Falsification de requ\u00eate c\u00f4t\u00e9 serveur et un maximum de 40 CWEs pour A04:2021-Conception non s\u00e9curis\u00e9e.

Nous avons appris que les organisations se concentraient sur les seules 30 CWEs et n'ajoutaient que rarement d'autres CWEs qu'elles rencontraient. Dans cette \u00e9dition, nous nous sommes content\u00e9s de demander des donn\u00e9es, sans aucune restriction sur les CWEs. Nous avons demand\u00e9 le nombre d'applications test\u00e9es pour une ann\u00e9e donn\u00e9e (\u00e0 partir de 2017), et le nombre d'applications avec au moins une instance d'une CWE trouv\u00e9e lors des tests. Ce format nous permet de d\u00e9terminer la pr\u00e9valence de chaque CWE au sein des applications. Nous ignorons la fr\u00e9quence pour nos besoins ; bien que cela pourrait \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaire dans d'autres situations, cela cache la pr\u00e9valence au sein du panel. Qu'une application ait quatre instances d'une CWE ou 4 000 ne fait pas partie du calcul du Top 10. Nous sommes pass\u00e9s d'approximativement 30 CWEs \u00e0 pr\u00e8s de 400 CWEs \u00e0 analyser dans le jeu de donn\u00e9es. Nous pr\u00e9voyons d'ajouter des analyses compl\u00e9mentaires dans le futur.

Nous aurions pu continuer encore pendant des mois. Nous avons d\u00fb nous arr\u00eater \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9. Il existe \u00e0 la fois des CWEs de type cause racine et sympt\u00f4me, o\u00f9 les types cause racine sont de la forme \"D\u00e9faillances cryptographiques\" et \"Mauvaise configuration\", en contraste avec les types sympt\u00f4me tels que \"Exposition de donn\u00e9es sensibles\" et \"D\u00e9ni de service\". Nous avons d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de nous concentrer sur les types cause racine autant que possible car ils sont plus logiques pour fournir des conseils d'identification et de rem\u00e9diation. Se concentrer sur la cause racine plut\u00f4t que le sympt\u00f4me n'est pas un nouveau concept ; le Top 10 a \u00e9t\u00e9 un m\u00e9lange de sympt\u00f4mes et de causes racines. Les CWEs le sont \u00e9galement ; nous faisons ce choix d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment et lan\u00e7ons un appel \u00e0 ce sujet. Il y a une moyenne de 19,6 CWEs par cat\u00e9gorie dans cette \u00e9dition, avec un minimum d'1 CWE pour A10:2021-Falsification de requ\u00eate c\u00f4t\u00e9 serveur et un maximum de 40 CWEs pour A04:2021-Conception non s\u00e9curis\u00e9e.

Prenez Cross-Site Scripting, qui est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement l'une de ces deux variantes : il s'agit soit d'une erreur mineure et isol\u00e9e, soit d'un probl\u00e8me syst\u00e9mique. Lorsqu'il s'agit d'un probl\u00e8me syst\u00e9mique, le nombre de constatations peut se chiffrer par milliers pour une seule application. Cette fr\u00e9quence \u00e9lev\u00e9e noie la plupart des autres vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9s trouv\u00e9es dans les rapports ou les donn\u00e9es.</p> <p>L'HaO, d'autre part, trouvera une gamme plus large de types de vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9s mais \u00e0 une fr\u00e9quence beaucoup plus faible en raison de contraintes de temps. Lorsque les humains testent une application et d\u00e9tectent une vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 comme Cross-Site Scripting, ils trouveront g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement trois ou quatre instances et s'arr\u00eateront. Ils peuvent d\u00e9terminer une d\u00e9couverte syst\u00e9mique et la r\u00e9diger avec une recommandation \u00e0 corriger \u00e0 l'\u00e9chelle de l'application. Il n'y a pas de besoin (ou de temps) de trouver chaque instance.</p> <p>Supposons que nous prenions ces deux ensembles de donn\u00e9es distincts et essayions de les fusionner en se basant sur la fr\u00e9quence. Dans ce cas, les donn\u00e9es d'outillage et d'OaH noieront les donn\u00e9es HaO plus pr\u00e9cises (mais plus larges) et expliquent en grande partie pourquoi une cat\u00e9gorie comme Cross-Site Scripting a \u00e9t\u00e9 si bien class\u00e9e dans de nombreuses listes alors que l'impact est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement faible \u00e0 mod\u00e9r\u00e9. C'est \u00e0 cause du volume consid\u00e9rable de r\u00e9sultats. Le Cross-Site Scripting est \u00e9galement assez facile \u00e0 tester, il y a donc beaucoup plus de tests pour cela.</p> <p>En 2017, nous avons introduit le taux d'incidence pour jeter un nouveau regard sur les donn\u00e9es et fusionner proprement les donn\u00e9es d'outillage et d'OaH avec les donn\u00e9es d'HaO. Le taux d'incidence demande quel pourcentage de la population d'applications avait au moins une instance d'un type de vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9. Peu nous importe si c'\u00e9tait ponctuel ou syst\u00e9mique. Ce n'est pas pertinent pour nos fins ; nous avons seulement besoin de savoir combien d'applications ont eu au moins une instance, ce qui permet de fournir une vue plus claire des r\u00e9sultats des tests sur plusieurs types de tests sans noyer les donn\u00e9es dans des r\u00e9sultats \u00e0 haute fr\u00e9quence. Cela correspond \u00e0 une vue li\u00e9e au risque, car un attaquant n'a besoin que d'une seule instance pour attaquer une application avec succ\u00e8s via la cat\u00e9gorie.</p>"},{"location":"fr/A00_2021_Introduction/#quel-est-votre-processus-de-collecte-et-danalyse-des-donnees","title":"Quel est votre processus de collecte et d'analyse des donn\u00e9es ?","text":"<p>Nous avons formalis\u00e9 le processus de collecte de donn\u00e9es de l'OWASP Top 10 lors de l'Open Security Summit en 2017.

Berikut adalah ringkasan tingkat tinggi dari perubahan kategori</p> <p>Upaya pengumpulan data sebelumnya difokuskan pada subset yang ditentukan sekitar 30 CWE dengan bidang yang meminta temuan tambahan. Kami mengetahui bahwa organisasi akan fokus hanya pada 30 CWE tersebut dan jarang menambahkan CWE tambahan yang mereka lihat. Dalam iterasi ini, kami membukanya dan hanya meminta data, tanpa batasan pada CWE. Kami meminta jumlah aplikasi yang diuji untuk tahun tertentu (mulai 2017), dan jumlah aplikasi dengan setidaknya satu contoh CWE yang ditemukan dalam pengujian. Format ini memungkinkan kami untuk melacak seberapa lazim setiap CWE dalam populasi aplikasi. Kami mengabaikan frekuensi untuk tujuan kami; sementara mungkin diperlukan untuk situasi lain, itu hanya menyembunyikan prevalensi aktual dalam populasi aplikasi. Apakah sebuah aplikasi memiliki empat instans CWE atau 4.000 instans bukanlah bagian dari perhitungan untuk 10 Besar. Kami beralih dari sekitar 30 CWE menjadi hampir 400 CWE untuk dianalisis dalam kumpulan data. Kami berencana untuk melakukan analisis data tambahan sebagai suplemen di masa depan. Peningkatan jumlah CWE yang signifikan ini memerlukan perubahan pada struktur kategori.</p> <p>Kami menghabiskan beberapa bulan untuk mengelompokkan dan mengkategorikan CWE dan dapat melanjutkannya selama beberapa bulan lagi. Kami harus berhenti di beberapa titik. Ada akar penyebab dan jenis gejala CWE, di mana jenis akar penyebab seperti \"Kegagalan Kriptografis\" dan \"Kesalahan Konfigurasi\" kontras dengan jenis gejala seperti \"Pengungkapan Data Sensitif\" dan \"Penolakan Layanan.\" Kami memutuskan untuk fokus pada akar penyebab bila memungkinkan karena lebih logis untuk memberikan panduan identifikasi dan perbaikan. Berfokus pada akar penyebab di atas gejala bukanlah konsep baru; Sepuluh Besar telah menjadi campuran gejala dan akar penyebab. CWE juga merupakan campuran dari gejala dan akar penyebab; kami hanya menjadi lebih berhati-hati tentang hal itu dan menyebutnya. Ada rata-rata 19,6 CWE per kategori dalam pemasangan ini, dengan batas bawah pada 1 CWE untuk A10:2021-Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) hingga 40 CWE dalam A04:2021-Insecure Design. Struktur kategori yang diperbarui ini menawarkan manfaat pelatihan tambahan karena perusahaan dapat fokus pada CWE yang masuk akal untuk bahasa/kerangka kerja.    </p>"},{"location":"id/#bagaimana-data-digunakan-untuk-memilih-kategori","title":"Bagaimana data digunakan untuk memilih kategori","text":"<p>Pada tahun 2017, kami memilih kategori berdasarkan tingkat insiden untuk menentukan kemungkinan, lalu memeringkatnya berdasarkan diskusi tim berdasarkan pengalaman puluhan tahun untuk Exploitability, Detectability (juga kemungkinan), dan Dampak Teknis. Untuk tahun 2021, kami ingin menggunakan data untuk Exploitability and Impact jika memungkinkan.</p> <p>Kami mengunduh Pemeriksaan Ketergantungan OWASP dan mengekstrak Eksploitasi CVSS, dan skor Dampak yang dikelompokkan berdasarkan CWE terkait. Butuh sedikit riset dan usaha karena semua CVE memiliki skor CVSSv2, tetapi ada kekurangan dalam CVSSv2 yang harus diatasi oleh CVSSv3. Setelah titik waktu tertentu, semua CVE juga diberi skor CVSSv3. Selain itu, rentang penilaian dan formula diperbarui antara CVSSv2 dan CVSSv3.</p> <p>Di CVSSv2, Eksploitasi dan Dampak bisa mencapai 10,0, tetapi rumusnya akan menjatuhkannya hingga 60% untuk Eksploitasi dan 40% untuk Dampak. Di CVSSv3, maks secara teori dibatasi hingga 6,0 untuk Eksploitasi dan 4,0 untuk Dampak. Dengan mempertimbangkan pembobotan, skor Dampak bergeser lebih tinggi, rata-rata hampir satu setengah poin di CVSSv3, dan kemampuan eksploitasi turun rata-rata hampir setengah poin.</p> <p>Ada 125 ribu catatan CVE yang dipetakan ke CWE dalam data NVD yang diekstraksi dari OWASP Dependency Check, dan ada 241 CWE unik yang dipetakan ke CVE. Peta CWE 62 ribu memiliki skor CVSSv3, yang kira-kira setengah dari populasi dalam kumpulan data.</p> <p>Untuk Top 10, kami menghitung rata-rata skor eksploitasi dan dampak dengan cara berikut. Kami mengelompokkan semua CVE dengan skor CVSS berdasarkan CWE dan memberi bobot pada skor eksploitasi dan dampak berdasarkan persentase populasi yang memiliki skor CVSSv3 + populasi yang tersisa dari skor CVSSv2 untuk mendapatkan rata-rata keseluruhan. Kami memetakan rata-rata ini ke CWE dalam kumpulan data untuk digunakan sebagai skor Eksploitasi dan Dampak untuk separuh persamaan risiko lainnya.</p>"},{"location":"id/#kenapa-tidak-hanya-bersumber-dari-data-statistik-murni","title":"Kenapa tidak hanya bersumber dari data statistik murni?","text":"<p>Hasil dalam data utamanya terbatas pada apa yang dapat kami uji secara otomatis.

Kami mengidentifikasi mereka sebagai Human-assisted Tooling (HaT), Tool-assisted Human (TaH), dan raw Tooling.</p> <p>Tooling dan HaT adalah generator pencarian frekuensi tinggi. Alat akan mencari kerentanan tertentu dan tanpa lelah berusaha untuk menemukan setiap contoh kerentanan itu dan akan menghasilkan jumlah temuan yang tinggi untuk beberapa jenis kerentanan. Lihatlah Cross-Site Scripting, yang biasanya merupakan salah satu dari dua rasa: itu kesalahan kecil yang terisolasi atau masalah sistemik. Jika ini merupakan masalah sistemik, jumlah temuan bisa mencapai ribuan untuk sebuah aplikasi. Frekuensi tinggi ini menenggelamkan sebagian besar kerentanan lain yang ditemukan dalam laporan atau data. TaH, di sisi lain, akan menemukan jenis kerentanan yang lebih luas tetapi pada frekuensi yang jauh lebih rendah karena kendala waktu. Ketika manusia menguji aplikasi dan melihat sesuatu seperti Cross-Site Scripting, mereka biasanya akan menemukan tiga atau empat instance dan berhenti. Mereka dapat menentukan temuan sistemik dan menuliskannya dengan rekomendasi untuk diperbaiki pada skala aplikasi yang luas. Tidak perlu (atau waktu) untuk menemukan setiap contoh.</p> <p>Misalkan kita mengambil dua kumpulan data yang berbeda ini dan mencoba menggabungkannya pada frekuensi. Dalam hal ini, data Tooling dan HaT akan menenggelamkan data TaH yang lebih akurat (tetapi luas) dan merupakan bagian yang baik dari mengapa sesuatu seperti Cross-Site Scripting memiliki peringkat yang sangat tinggi di banyak daftar ketika dampaknya umumnya rendah hingga sedang. Itu karena banyaknya temuan. (Cross-Site Scripting juga cukup mudah untuk diuji, jadi ada lebih banyak tes untuk itu juga). Pada tahun 2017, kami memperkenalkan penggunaan tingkat insiden sebagai gantinya untuk melihat data baru dan menggabungkan data Tooling dan HaT dengan data TaH dengan rapi. Tingkat insiden menanyakan berapa persentase populasi aplikasi yang memiliki setidaknya satu contoh jenis kerentanan. Kami tidak peduli apakah itu satu kali atau sistemik. Itu tidak relevan untuk tujuan kita; kita hanya perlu mengetahui berapa banyak aplikasi yang memiliki setidaknya satu instance, yang membantu memberikan pandangan yang lebih jelas tentang pengujian temuan di beberapa jenis pengujian tanpa menenggelamkan data dalam hasil frekuensi tinggi.</p>"},{"location":"id/#apa-proses-pengumpulan-dan-analisis-data-anda","title":"Apa proses pengumpulan dan analisis data Anda?","text":"<p>Kami meresmikan proses pengumpulan data OWASP Top 10 di Open Security Summit pada 2017.

Berikut adalah ringkasan tingkat tinggi dari perubahan kategori</p> <p>Upaya pengumpulan data sebelumnya difokuskan pada subset yang ditentukan sekitar 30 CWE dengan bidang yang meminta temuan tambahan. Kami mengetahui bahwa organisasi akan fokus hanya pada 30 CWE tersebut dan jarang menambahkan CWE tambahan yang mereka lihat. Dalam iterasi ini, kami membukanya dan hanya meminta data, tanpa batasan pada CWE. Kami meminta jumlah aplikasi yang diuji untuk tahun tertentu (mulai 2017), dan jumlah aplikasi dengan setidaknya satu contoh CWE yang ditemukan dalam pengujian. Format ini memungkinkan kami untuk melacak seberapa lazim setiap CWE dalam populasi aplikasi. Kami mengabaikan frekuensi untuk tujuan kami; sementara mungkin diperlukan untuk situasi lain, itu hanya menyembunyikan prevalensi aktual dalam populasi aplikasi. Apakah sebuah aplikasi memiliki empat instans CWE atau 4.000 instans bukanlah bagian dari perhitungan untuk 10 Besar. Kami beralih dari sekitar 30 CWE menjadi hampir 400 CWE untuk dianalisis dalam kumpulan data. Kami berencana untuk melakukan analisis data tambahan sebagai suplemen di masa depan. Peningkatan jumlah CWE yang signifikan ini memerlukan perubahan pada struktur kategori.</p> <p>Kami menghabiskan beberapa bulan untuk mengelompokkan dan mengkategorikan CWE dan dapat melanjutkannya selama beberapa bulan lagi. Kami harus berhenti di beberapa titik. Ada akar penyebab dan jenis gejala CWE, di mana jenis akar penyebab seperti \"Kegagalan Kriptografis\" dan \"Kesalahan Konfigurasi\" kontras dengan jenis gejala seperti \"Pengungkapan Data Sensitif\" dan \"Penolakan Layanan.\" Kami memutuskan untuk fokus pada akar penyebab bila memungkinkan karena lebih logis untuk memberikan panduan identifikasi dan perbaikan. Berfokus pada akar penyebab di atas gejala bukanlah konsep baru; Sepuluh Besar telah menjadi campuran gejala dan akar penyebab. CWE juga merupakan campuran dari gejala dan akar penyebab; kami hanya menjadi lebih berhati-hati tentang hal itu dan menyebutnya. Ada rata-rata 19,6 CWE per kategori dalam pemasangan ini, dengan batas bawah pada 1 CWE untuk A10:2021-Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) hingga 40 CWE dalam A04:2021-Insecure Design.

Butuh sedikit riset dan usaha karena semua CVE memiliki skor CVSSv2, tetapi ada kekurangan dalam CVSSv2 yang harus diatasi oleh CVSSv3. Setelah titik waktu tertentu, semua CVE juga diberi skor CVSSv3. Selain itu, rentang penilaian dan formula diperbarui antara CVSSv2 dan CVSSv3.</p> <p>Di CVSSv2, Eksploitasi dan Dampak bisa mencapai 10,0, tetapi rumusnya akan menjatuhkannya hingga 60% untuk Eksploitasi dan 40% untuk Dampak. Di CVSSv3, maks secara teori dibatasi hingga 6,0 untuk Eksploitasi dan 4,0 untuk Dampak. Dengan mempertimbangkan pembobotan, skor Dampak bergeser lebih tinggi, rata-rata hampir satu setengah poin di CVSSv3, dan kemampuan eksploitasi turun rata-rata hampir setengah poin.</p> <p>Ada 125 ribu catatan CVE yang dipetakan ke CWE dalam data NVD yang diekstraksi dari OWASP Dependency Check, dan ada 241 CWE unik yang dipetakan ke CVE.

Kami mengidentifikasi mereka sebagai Human-assisted Tooling (HaT), Tool-assisted Human (TaH), dan raw Tooling.</p> <p>Tooling dan HaT adalah generator pencarian frekuensi tinggi. Alat akan mencari kerentanan tertentu dan tanpa lelah berusaha untuk menemukan setiap contoh kerentanan itu dan akan menghasilkan jumlah temuan yang tinggi untuk beberapa jenis kerentanan. Lihatlah Cross-Site Scripting, yang biasanya merupakan salah satu dari dua rasa: itu kesalahan kecil yang terisolasi atau masalah sistemik. Jika ini merupakan masalah sistemik, jumlah temuan bisa mencapai ribuan untuk sebuah aplikasi. Frekuensi tinggi ini menenggelamkan sebagian besar kerentanan lain yang ditemukan dalam laporan atau data. TaH, di sisi lain, akan menemukan jenis kerentanan yang lebih luas tetapi pada frekuensi yang jauh lebih rendah karena kendala waktu. Ketika manusia menguji aplikasi dan melihat sesuatu seperti Cross-Site Scripting, mereka biasanya akan menemukan tiga atau empat instance dan berhenti. Mereka dapat menentukan temuan sistemik dan menuliskannya dengan rekomendasi untuk diperbaiki pada skala aplikasi yang luas. Tidak perlu (atau waktu) untuk menemukan setiap contoh.</p> <p>Misalkan kita mengambil dua kumpulan data yang berbeda ini dan mencoba menggabungkannya pada frekuensi. Dalam hal ini, data Tooling dan HaT akan menenggelamkan data TaH yang lebih akurat (tetapi luas) dan merupakan bagian yang baik dari mengapa sesuatu seperti Cross-Site Scripting memiliki peringkat yang sangat tinggi di banyak daftar ketika dampaknya umumnya rendah hingga sedang. Itu karena banyaknya temuan. (Cross-Site Scripting juga cukup mudah untuk diuji, jadi ada lebih banyak tes untuk itu juga). Pada tahun 2017, kami memperkenalkan penggunaan tingkat insiden sebagai gantinya untuk melihat data baru dan menggabungkan data Tooling dan HaT dengan data TaH dengan rapi. Tingkat insiden menanyakan berapa persentase populasi aplikasi yang memiliki setidaknya satu contoh jenis kerentanan. Kami tidak peduli apakah itu satu kali atau sistemik. Itu tidak relevan untuk tujuan kita; kita hanya perlu mengetahui berapa banyak aplikasi yang memiliki setidaknya satu instance, yang membantu memberikan pandangan yang lebih jelas tentang pengujian temuan di beberapa jenis pengujian tanpa menenggelamkan data dalam hasil frekuensi tinggi.</p>"},{"location":"id/A00_2021_Introduction/#apa-proses-pengumpulan-dan-analisis-data-anda","title":"Apa proses pengumpulan dan analisis data Anda?","text":"<p>Kami meresmikan proses pengumpulan data OWASP Top 10 di Open Security Summit pada 2017.

Questo lo facciamo per una ragione fondamentale, guardare i dati forniti \u00e8 guardare nel passato. I ricercatori nel campo dell'AppSec impiegano tempo per trovare nuove vulnerabilit\u00e0 e nuovi modi per testarle. Ci vuole tempo per integrare questi test negli strumenti e nei processi. Nel momento in cui possiamo testare in modo affidabile una debolezza su larga scala, probabilmente sono passati anni. Per bilanciare questo punto di vista, usiamo un sondaggio comunitario per chiedere agli esperti di sicurezza e sviluppatori di applicazioni in prima linea quali sono le debolezze essenziali che i dati potrebbero non mostrare ancora.</p> <p>Ci sono alcuni cambiamenti importanti che abbiamo adottato per continuare a migliorare la Top 10.</p>"},{"location":"it/#come-sono-strutturate-le-categorie","title":"Come sono strutturate le categorie","text":"<p>Alcune categorie sono cambiate dalla precedente versione della Top Ten di OWASP. Ecco un riassunto ad alto livello dei cambiamenti relativi alle categorie.</p> <p>I precedenti sforzi di raccolta dati erano focalizzati su un sottoinsieme prescritto di circa 30 CWE con un campo aperto che ne richiedeva altri. Abbiamo imparato che le organizzazioni si concentravano principalmente solo su quelle 30 CWE e raramente aggiungevano ulteriori CWE che avevano incontrato. In questa iterazione abbiamo chiesto solo dati, senza restrizioni sulle CWE. Abbiamo chiesto il numero di applicazioni testate per un dato anno (a partire dal 2017), e il numero di applicazioni con almeno un'istanza di una CWE trovata nei test. Questo formato ci permette di tracciare quanto sia prevalente ogni CWE all'interno della popolazione delle applicazioni. Per i nostri scopi ignoriamo la frequenza; mentre pu\u00f2 essere necessaria per altre situazioni, nasconde solo la reale prevalenza nella popolazione delle applicazioni. Che un'applicazione abbia quattro istanze di una CWE o 4.000 istanze, questo valore non influisce nel calcolo per la Top 10. Siamo passati da circa 30 CWE a quasi 400 CWE da analizzare. In futuro abbiamo in programma di fare ulteriori analisi dei dati come integrazione. Questo aumento significativo del numero di CWE richiede cambiamenti nel modo in cui le categorie sono strutturate.</p> <p>Abbiamo trascorso diversi mesi a raggruppare e categorizzare le CWE e avremmo potuto continuare per mesi. Ad un certo punto ci siamo dovuti fermare. Ci sono entrambi i tipi di CWE causa principale e sintomo, dove i tipi causa principale sono come \"Cryptographic Failures\" e \"Misconfiguration\" in contrasto con i tipi sintomo come \"Sensitive Data Exposure\" e \"Denial of Service\". Abbiamo deciso di concentrarci sulla causa principale ogni volta che \u00e8 possibile, in quanto \u00e8 pi\u00f9 logico per fornire una guida all'identificazione e al rimedio. Concentrarsi sulla causa principale piuttosto che sul sintomo non \u00e8 un concetto nuovo; la Top Ten \u00e8 stata un mix di sintomo e causa principale. Anche le CWE sono un mix di sintomo e causa principale; siamo semplicemente pi\u00f9 consapevoli di questo e lo diciamo ad alta voce. C'\u00e8 una media di 19.6 CWE per categoria in questa versione, con i limiti inferiori a 1 CWE per A10:2021-Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) a 40 CWE in A04:2021-Insecure Design. Questa struttura aggiornata delle categorie offre ulteriori benefici per la formazione in quanto le aziende possono concentrarsi sulle CWE che hanno senso per un linguaggio/framework.</p>"},{"location":"it/#come-vengono-usati-i-dati-per-selezionare-le-categorie","title":"Come vengono usati i dati per selezionare le categorie","text":"<p>Nel 2017, abbiamo selezionato le categorie in base al tasso di incidenza per determinare la probabilit\u00e0, poi le abbiamo classificate in base alla discussione con il team sulla base di decenni di esperienza per Exploitability, Detectability (anche likelihood), e Technical Impact. Per il 2021, vogliamo usare i dati per Exploitability e (Technical) Impact se possibile.</p> <p>Abbiamo scaricato OWASP Dependency Check ed estratto i punteggi CVSS relativi a Exploit e Impact raggruppati per CWE correlati. Ci sono voluti un bel po' di ricerche e sforzi, poich\u00e9 tutti i CVE hanno punteggi CVSSv2, ma ci sono problematiche in CVSSv2 che CVSSv3 dovrebbe risolvere. Dopo un certo periodo di tempo, a tutti i CVE viene assegnato anche un punteggio CVSSv3. Inoltre, gli intervalli di punteggio e le formule sono stati aggiornati tra CVSSv2 e CVSSv3.</p> <p>Nel CVSSv2, sia Exploit che (Technical) Impact potevano essere fino a 10.0, ma la formula li riduceva al 60% per Exploit e al 40% per Impact. Nel CVSSv3, il massimo teorico era limitato a 6.0 per Exploit e 4.0 per Impact. Con la ponderazione considerata, il punteggio di Impact si \u00e8 spostato pi\u00f9 in alto, quasi un punto e mezzo in media in CVSSv3, e l'exploitability si \u00e8 spostato quasi mezzo punto pi\u00f9 in basso in media.</p> <p>Ci sono 125k record di una CVE corrispondente a una CWE nei dati del National Vulnerability Database (NVD) estratti da OWASP Dependency Check, e ci sono 241 CWE uniche corrispondenti a un CVE. 62k corrispondenze di CWE hanno un punteggio CVSSv3, che \u00e8 circa la met\u00e0 della popolazione nel set di dati.</p> <p>Per la Top Ten 2021, abbiamo calcolato i punteggi medi di Exploit e Impact nel modo seguente. Abbiamo raggruppato tutte le CVE con punteggi CVSS per CWE e ponderato entrambi i punteggi di Exploit e Impact per la percentuale della popolazione che aveva CVSSv3 pi\u00f9 la restante popolazione di punteggi CVSSv2 per ottenere una media complessiva. Abbiamo messo in corrispondenza queste medie alle CWE nel dataset da usare come punteggio di Exploit e (Technical) Impact per l'altra met\u00e0 dell'equazione del rischio.</p>"},{"location":"it/#perche-non-utilizzare-dati-puramente-statistici","title":"Perch\u00e8 non utilizzare dati puramente statistici?","text":"<p>I risultati nei dati sono principalmente limitati a ci\u00f2 che possiamo testare in modo automatico. Parlate con un professionista esperto di AppSec e vi racconter\u00e0 delle vulnerabilit\u00e0 che trova e delle tendenze che vede che non sono ancora visibili nei dati. Ci vuole tempo perch\u00e9 le persone sviluppino metodologie di test per certi tipi di vulnerabilit\u00e0 e poi ancora pi\u00f9 tempo perch\u00e9 quei test siano automatizzati ed eseguiti su una vasta popolazione di applicazioni.

Gli strumenti cercheranno vulnerabilit\u00e0 specifiche e tenteranno instancabilmente di trovare ogni istanza di quella vulnerabilit\u00e0 e genereranno un numero elevato di risultati per alcuni tipi di vulnerabilit\u00e0. Guardate il Cross-Site Scripting, che \u00e8 tipicamente di due tipi: o \u00e8 un errore piccolo e isolato o un problema sistemico. Quando si tratta di un problema sistemico, il conteggio pu\u00f2 essere di migliaia per una singola applicazione. Questa alta frequenza copre la maggior parte delle altre vulnerabilit\u00e0 trovate nei report o nei dati.</p> <p>TaH, d'altra parte, trover\u00e0 una gamma pi\u00f9 ampia di tipi di vulnerabilit\u00e0, ma con una frequenza molto pi\u00f9 bassa a causa dei vincoli temporali. Quando gli esseri umani testano un'applicazione e identificano problematiche come il Cross-Site Scripting, in genere trovano tre o quattro istanze e si fermano. Possono determinare una scoperta sistemica e scrivere nel report consigli per la correzione della problematica sull'intera applicazione. Non c'\u00e8 bisogno (o tempo) di trovare ogni istanza.</p> <p>Supponiamo di prendere questi due insiemi di dati distinti e cercare di unirli ina base alla frequenza.

Il tasso di incidenza chiede quale percentuale della popolazione di applicazioni ha avuto almeno un'istanza di un tipo di vulnerabilit\u00e0. Non ci interessa se era una tantum o sistemica. Questo \u00e8 irrilevante per i nostri scopi; abbiamo solo bisogno di sapere quante applicazioni ne avevano almeno un'istanza, il che aiuta a fornire una visione pi\u00f9 chiara dei risultati senza rischiare di inquinare i dati con risultati relativi a problematiche ad alta frequenza.

Quando necessario abbiamo cambiato i nomi per concentrarci pi\u00f9 sulla causa principale anzich\u00e8 sui sintomi.</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>A01:2021-Broken Access Control sale dalla quinta posizione alla categoria con il pi\u00f9 grave rischio per la sicurezza delle applicazioni web; i dati analizzati indicano che in media, il 3,81% delle applicazioni testate aveva una o pi\u00f9 Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) con pi\u00f9 di 318k occorrenze di CWEs in questa categoria di rischio. Le 34 CWE che corrispondevano a Broken Access Control avevano pi\u00f9 occorrenze di qualsiasi altra categoria.</li> <li>A02:2021-Cryptographic Failures si sposta di una posizione alla #2, precedentemente nota come A3:2017-Sensitive Data Exposure, che era un sintomo generico piuttosto che la causa principale. Il nome rinnovato si concentra sulle problematiche relative alla crittografia come \u00e8 stato prima, ma implicitamente. Questa categoria porta spesso all'esposizione di dati sensibili o alla compromissione del sistema.</li> <li>A03:2021-Injection scivola in terza posizione. Il 94% delle applicazioni \u00e8 stato testato per qualche forma di injection con un tasso di incidenza massimo del 19%, un tasso di incidenza medio del 3,37%, e le 33 CWE che corrispondevano a questa categoria hanno il secondo maggior numero di occorrenze nelle applicazioni, con 274k. In questa edizione il Cross-site Scripting fa parte di questa categoria.</li> <li>A04:2021-Insecure Design \u00e8 una nuova categoria per il 2021, con un focus sui rischi relativi ai difetti di progettazione. Se vogliamo veramente \"spostarci a sinistra\" come industria, abbiamo bisogno di pi\u00f9 threat modeling, secure design patterns e architetture di riferimento. Un design insicuro non pu\u00f2 essere corretto con un'implementazione perfetta, poich\u00e9 per definizione i controlli di sicurezza necessari non sono mai stati creati per difendersi da attacchi specifici.</li> <li>A05:2021-Security Misconfiguration sale dal numero 6 dell'edizione precedente; il 90% delle applicazioni \u00e8 stato testato per qualche forma di misconfigurazione, con un tasso di incidenza medio del 4,5% e oltre 208k casi di CWE corrispondenti a questa categoria di rischio. Con una tendenza al software altamente configurabile, non \u00e8 sorprendente vedere questa categoria salire. La precedente categoria per A4:2017-XML External Entities (XXE) \u00e8 ora parte di questa categoria di rischio.</li> <li>A06:2021-Vulnerable and Outdated Components era precedentemente intitolata \"Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities\" ed \u00e8 #2 nel sondaggio della comunit\u00e0 Top 10, ma aveva anche abbastanza numeri per far parte della Top 10 grazie ai dati raccolti e analizzati. Questa categoria sale dalla #9 del 2017 ed \u00e8 un problema noto per cui facciamo fatica a testare e a valutarne il rischio. \u00c8 l'unica categoria a non avere alcun Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVE) corrispondente alle CWE incluse, quindi nel punteggio \u00e8 stato inserito un peso predefinito per sfruttabilit\u00e0 e impatto di 5.0.</li> <li>A07:2021-Identification and Authentication Failures era precedentemente nota come \"Broken Authentication\" e sta scivolando gi\u00f9 dalla seconda posizione, e ora include CWEs che sono pi\u00f9 legate a problematiche di identificazione. Questa categoria \u00e8 ancora parte integrante della Top 10, ma la maggiore diffusione di framework standard sembra aiutare.</li> <li>A08:2021-Software and Data Integrity Failures \u00e8 una nuova categoria per il 2021, che si concentra sul fare ipotesi relative agli aggiornamenti del software, ai dati critici e alle pipeline CI/CD senza verificare l'integrit\u00e0. Uno dei pi\u00f9 alti impatti ponderati dai dati di Common Vulnerability and Exposures/Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVE/CVSS) \u00e8 stato messo in corrispondenza alle 10 CWE di questa categoria. A8:2017-Insecure Deserialization fa ora parte di questa categoria pi\u00f9 ampia.</li> <li>A09:2021-Security Logging and Monitoring Failures era precedentemente A10:2017-Insufficient Logging &amp; Monitoring e viene aggiunto dal sondaggio della comunit\u00e0 Top 10 (#3), passando dalla precedente #10. Questa categoria \u00e8 stata ampliata per includere pi\u00f9 tipi di problematiche, \u00e8 difficile da testare e non \u00e8 ben rappresentata nei dati CVE/CVSS. Tuttavia, le problematiche in questa categoria possono avere un impatto diretto sulla visibilit\u00e0, sull'alerting degli incidenti e sulle attivit\u00e0 forensi.</li> <li>A10:2021-Server-Side Request Forgery viene aggiunto dal sondaggio della comunit\u00e0 Top 10 (#1). I dati mostrano un tasso di incidenza relativamente basso con una copertura di test superiore alla media, insieme a valutazioni superiori alla media per il potenziale di sfruttabilit\u00e0 e di impatto.

Questo lo facciamo per una ragione fondamentale, guardare i dati forniti \u00e8 guardare nel passato. I ricercatori nel campo dell'AppSec impiegano tempo per trovare nuove vulnerabilit\u00e0 e nuovi modi per testarle. Ci vuole tempo per integrare questi test negli strumenti e nei processi. Nel momento in cui possiamo testare in modo affidabile una debolezza su larga scala, probabilmente sono passati anni. Per bilanciare questo punto di vista, usiamo un sondaggio comunitario per chiedere agli esperti di sicurezza e sviluppatori di applicazioni in prima linea quali sono le debolezze essenziali che i dati potrebbero non mostrare ancora.</p> <p>Ci sono alcuni cambiamenti importanti che abbiamo adottato per continuare a migliorare la Top 10.</p>"},{"location":"it/A00_2021_Introduction/#come-sono-strutturate-le-categorie","title":"Come sono strutturate le categorie","text":"<p>Alcune categorie sono cambiate dalla precedente versione della Top Ten di OWASP. Ecco un riassunto ad alto livello dei cambiamenti relativi alle categorie.</p> <p>I precedenti sforzi di raccolta dati erano focalizzati su un sottoinsieme prescritto di circa 30 CWE con un campo aperto che ne richiedeva altri. Abbiamo imparato che le organizzazioni si concentravano principalmente solo su quelle 30 CWE e raramente aggiungevano ulteriori CWE che avevano incontrato. In questa iterazione abbiamo chiesto solo dati, senza restrizioni sulle CWE. Abbiamo chiesto il numero di applicazioni testate per un dato anno (a partire dal 2017), e il numero di applicazioni con almeno un'istanza di una CWE trovata nei test. Questo formato ci permette di tracciare quanto sia prevalente ogni CWE all'interno della popolazione delle applicazioni. Per i nostri scopi ignoriamo la frequenza; mentre pu\u00f2 essere necessaria per altre situazioni, nasconde solo la reale prevalenza nella popolazione delle applicazioni. Che un'applicazione abbia quattro istanze di una CWE o 4.000 istanze, questo valore non influisce nel calcolo per la Top 10. Siamo passati da circa 30 CWE a quasi 400 CWE da analizzare. In futuro abbiamo in programma di fare ulteriori analisi dei dati come integrazione. Questo aumento significativo del numero di CWE richiede cambiamenti nel modo in cui le categorie sono strutturate.</p> <p>Abbiamo trascorso diversi mesi a raggruppare e categorizzare le CWE e avremmo potuto continuare per mesi. Ad un certo punto ci siamo dovuti fermare. Ci sono entrambi i tipi di CWE causa principale e sintomo, dove i tipi causa principale sono come \"Cryptographic Failures\" e \"Misconfiguration\" in contrasto con i tipi sintomo come \"Sensitive Data Exposure\" e \"Denial of Service\". Abbiamo deciso di concentrarci sulla causa principale ogni volta che \u00e8 possibile, in quanto \u00e8 pi\u00f9 logico per fornire una guida all'identificazione e al rimedio. Concentrarsi sulla causa principale piuttosto che sul sintomo non \u00e8 un concetto nuovo; la Top Ten \u00e8 stata un mix di sintomo e causa principale. Anche le CWE sono un mix di sintomo e causa principale; siamo semplicemente pi\u00f9 consapevoli di questo e lo diciamo ad alta voce. C'\u00e8 una media di 19.6 CWE per categoria in questa versione, con i limiti inferiori a 1 CWE per A10:2021-Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) a 40 CWE in A04:2021-Insecure Design. Questa struttura aggiornata delle categorie offre ulteriori benefici per la formazione in quanto le aziende possono concentrarsi sulle CWE che hanno senso per un linguaggio/framework.</p>"},{"location":"it/A00_2021_Introduction/#come-vengono-usati-i-dati-per-selezionare-le-categorie","title":"Come vengono usati i dati per selezionare le categorie","text":"<p>Nel 2017, abbiamo selezionato le categorie in base al tasso di incidenza per determinare la probabilit\u00e0, poi le abbiamo classificate in base alla discussione con il team sulla base di decenni di esperienza per Exploitability, Detectability (anche likelihood), e Technical Impact. Per il 2021, vogliamo usare i dati per Exploitability e (Technical) Impact se possibile.</p> <p>Abbiamo scaricato OWASP Dependency Check ed estratto i punteggi CVSS relativi a Exploit e Impact raggruppati per CWE correlati. Ci sono voluti un bel po' di ricerche e sforzi, poich\u00e9 tutti i CVE hanno punteggi CVSSv2, ma ci sono problematiche in CVSSv2 che CVSSv3 dovrebbe risolvere. Dopo un certo periodo di tempo, a tutti i CVE viene assegnato anche un punteggio CVSSv3. Inoltre, gli intervalli di punteggio e le formule sono stati aggiornati tra CVSSv2 e CVSSv3.</p> <p>Nel CVSSv2, sia Exploit che (Technical) Impact potevano essere fino a 10.0, ma la formula li riduceva al 60% per Exploit e al 40% per Impact. Nel CVSSv3, il massimo teorico era limitato a 6.0 per Exploit e 4.0 per Impact. Con la ponderazione considerata, il punteggio di Impact si \u00e8 spostato pi\u00f9 in alto, quasi un punto e mezzo in media in CVSSv3, e l'exploitability si \u00e8 spostato quasi mezzo punto pi\u00f9 in basso in media.</p> <p>Ci sono 125k record di una CVE corrispondente a una CWE nei dati del National Vulnerability Database (NVD) estratti da OWASP Dependency Check, e ci sono 241 CWE uniche corrispondenti a un CVE. 62k corrispondenze di CWE hanno un punteggio CVSSv3, che \u00e8 circa la met\u00e0 della popolazione nel set di dati.</p> <p>Per la Top Ten 2021, abbiamo calcolato i punteggi medi di Exploit e Impact nel modo seguente. Abbiamo raggruppato tutte le CVE con punteggi CVSS per CWE e ponderato entrambi i punteggi di Exploit e Impact per la percentuale della popolazione che aveva CVSSv3 pi\u00f9 la restante popolazione di punteggi CVSSv2 per ottenere una media complessiva. Abbiamo messo in corrispondenza queste medie alle CWE nel dataset da usare come punteggio di Exploit e (Technical) Impact per l'altra met\u00e0 dell'equazione del rischio.</p>"},{"location":"it/A00_2021_Introduction/#perche-non-utilizzare-dati-puramente-statistici","title":"Perch\u00e8 non utilizzare dati puramente statistici?","text":"<p>I risultati nei dati sono principalmente limitati a ci\u00f2 che possiamo testare in modo automatico.

Gli strumenti cercheranno vulnerabilit\u00e0 specifiche e tenteranno instancabilmente di trovare ogni istanza di quella vulnerabilit\u00e0 e genereranno un numero elevato di risultati per alcuni tipi di vulnerabilit\u00e0. Guardate il Cross-Site Scripting, che \u00e8 tipicamente di due tipi: o \u00e8 un errore piccolo e isolato o un problema sistemico. Quando si tratta di un problema sistemico, il conteggio pu\u00f2 essere di migliaia per una singola applicazione. Questa alta frequenza copre la maggior parte delle altre vulnerabilit\u00e0 trovate nei report o nei dati.</p> <p>TaH, d'altra parte, trover\u00e0 una gamma pi\u00f9 ampia di tipi di vulnerabilit\u00e0, ma con una frequenza molto pi\u00f9 bassa a causa dei vincoli temporali. Quando gli esseri umani testano un'applicazione e identificano problematiche come il Cross-Site Scripting, in genere trovano tre o quattro istanze e si fermano. Possono determinare una scoperta sistemica e scrivere nel report consigli per la correzione della problematica sull'intera applicazione. Non c'\u00e8 bisogno (o tempo) di trovare ogni istanza.</p> <p>Supponiamo di prendere questi due insiemi di dati distinti e cercare di unirli ina base alla frequenza.

Il tasso di incidenza chiede quale percentuale della popolazione di applicazioni ha avuto almeno un'istanza di un tipo di vulnerabilit\u00e0. Non ci interessa se era una tantum o sistemica. Questo \u00e8 irrilevante per i nostri scopi; abbiamo solo bisogno di sapere quante applicazioni ne avevano almeno un'istanza, il che aiuta a fornire una visione pi\u00f9 chiara dei risultati senza rischiare di inquinare i dati con risultati relativi a problematiche ad alta frequenza.

The paved road aims to continuously improve, measure, detect and replace insecure alternatives by having an enterprise-wide library of drop-in secured replacements, with tooling to help see where improvements can be made by adopting the paved road. This allows existing development tools to report on insecure builds and help development teams self-correct away from insecure alternatives.</p> <p>The paved road might seem a lot to take in, but it should be built incrementally over time.

to use the OWASP Top 10 as a standard","text":"<p>The OWASP Top 10 is primarily an awareness document. However, this has not stopped organizations using it as a de facto industry AppSec standard since its inception in 2003. If you want to use the OWASP Top 10 as a coding or testing standard, know that it is the bare minimum and just a starting point.</p> <p>One of the difficulties of using the OWASP Top 10 as a standard is that we document appsec risks, and not necessarily easily testable issues. For example, A04:2021-Insecure Design is beyond the scope of most forms of testing. Another example is testing in place, in use, and effective logging and monitoring can only be done with interviews and requesting a sampling of effective incident responses. A static code analysis tool can look for the absence of logging, but it might be impossible to determine if business logic or access control is logging critical security breaches. Penetration testers may only be able to determine that they have invoked incident response in a test environment, which are rarely monitored in the same way as production.</p> <p>Here are our recommendations for when it is appropriate to use the OWASP Top 10:</p> Use Case OWASP Top 10 2021 OWASP Application Security Verification Standard Awareness Yes Training Entry level Comprehensive Design and architecture Occasionally Yes Coding standard Bare minimum Yes Secure Code review Bare minimum Yes Peer review checklist Bare minimum Yes Unit testing Occasionally Yes Integration testing Occasionally Yes Penetration testing Bare minimum Yes Tool support Bare minimum Yes Secure Supply Chain Occasionally Yes <p>We would encourage anyone wanting to adopt an application security standard to use the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS), as it\u2019s designed to be verifiable and tested, and can be used in all parts of a secure development lifecycle.</p> <p>The ASVS is the only acceptable choice for tool vendors. Tools cannot comprehensively detect, test, or protect against the OWASP Top 10 due to the nature of several of the OWASP Top 10 risks, with reference to A04:2021-Insecure Design. OWASP discourages any claims of full coverage of the OWASP Top 10, because it\u2019s simply untrue.</p>"},{"location":"ja/A00_2021_Introduction/","title":"\u5c0e\u5165","text":""},{"location":"ja/A00_2021_Introduction/#owasp-top-10-2021","title":"OWASP Top 10 - 2021 \u3078\u3088\u3046\u3053\u305d","text":"<p>OWASP \u30c8\u30c3\u30d7 10 \u306e\u6700\u65b0\u7248\u3078\u3088\u3046\u3053\u305d!

For example, passwords, credit card numbers, health records, personal information, and business secrets require extra protection, mainly if that data falls under privacy laws, e.g., EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), or regulations, e.g., financial data protection such as PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). For all such data:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Is any data transmitted in clear text? This concerns protocols such     as HTTP, SMTP, FTP also using TLS upgrades like STARTTLS. External     internet traffic is hazardous. Verify all internal traffic, e.g.,     between load balancers, web servers, or back-end systems.</p> </li> <li> <p>Are any old or weak cryptographic algorithms or protocols used either     by default or in older code?</p> </li> <li> <p>Are default crypto keys in use, weak crypto keys generated or     re-used, or is proper key management or rotation missing?     Are crypto keys checked into source code repositories?</p> </li> <li> <p>Is encryption not enforced, e.g., are any HTTP headers (browser)     security directives or headers missing?</p> </li> <li> <p>Is the received server certificate and the trust chain properly validated?</p> </li> <li> <p>Are initialization vectors ignored, reused, or not generated     sufficiently secure for the cryptographic mode of operation?     Is an insecure mode of operation such as ECB in use? Is encryption     used when authenticated encryption is more appropriate?</p> </li> <li> <p>Are passwords being used as cryptographic keys in absence of a     password base key derivation function?</p> </li> <li> <p>Is randomness used for cryptographic purposes that was not designed     to meet cryptographic requirements? Even if the correct function is     chosen, does it need to be seeded by the developer, and if not, has     the developer over-written the strong seeding functionality built into     it with a seed that lacks sufficient entropy/unpredictability?</p> </li> <li> <p>Are deprecated hash functions such as MD5 or SHA1 in use, or are     non-cryptographic hash functions used when cryptographic hash functions     are needed?</p> </li> <li> <p>Are deprecated cryptographic padding methods such as PKCS number 1 v1.5     in use?</p> </li> <li> <p>Are cryptographic error messages or side channel information     exploitable, for example in the form of padding oracle attacks?</p> </li> </ul> <p>See ASVS Crypto (V7), Data Protection (V9), and SSL/TLS (V10)</p>"},{"location":"ja/A02_2021-Cryptographic_Failures/#how-to-prevent","title":"How to Prevent","text":"<p>Do the following, at a minimum, and consult the references:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Classify data processed, stored, or transmitted by an application.     Identify which data is sensitive according to privacy laws,     regulatory requirements, or business needs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Don't store sensitive data unnecessarily. Discard it as soon as     possible or use PCI DSS compliant tokenization or even truncation.     Data that is not retained cannot be stolen.</p> </li> <li> <p>Make sure to encrypt all sensitive data at rest.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ensure up-to-date and strong standard algorithms, protocols, and     keys are in place; use proper key management.</p> </li> <li> <p>Encrypt all data in transit with secure protocols such as TLS with     forward secrecy (FS) ciphers, cipher prioritization by the     server, and secure parameters. Enforce encryption using directives     like HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS).</p> </li> <li> <p>Disable caching for response that contain sensitive data.</p> </li> <li> <p>Apply required security controls as per the data classification.</p> </li> <li> <p>Do not use legacy protocols such as FTP and SMTP for transporting     sensitive data.</p> </li> <li> <p>Store passwords using strong adaptive and salted hashing functions     with a work factor (delay factor), such as Argon2, scrypt, bcrypt or     PBKDF2.</p> </li> <li> <p>Initialization vectors must be chosen appropriate for the mode of     operation.  For many modes, this means using a CSPRNG (cryptographically     secure pseudo random number generator).  For modes that require a     nonce, then the initialization vector (IV) does not need a CSPRNG.  In all cases, the IV     should never be used twice for a fixed key.</p> </li> <li> <p>Always use authenticated encryption instead of just encryption.</p> </li> <li> <p>Keys should be generated cryptographically randomly and stored in     memory as byte arrays. If a password is used, then it must be converted     to a key via an appropriate password base key derivation function.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ensure that cryptographic randomness is used where appropriate, and     that it has not been seeded in a predictable way or with low entropy.     Most modern APIs do not require the developer to seed the CSPRNG to     get security.</p> </li> <li> <p>Avoid deprecated cryptographic functions and padding schemes, such as     MD5, SHA1, PKCS number 1 v1.5 .</p> </li> <li> <p>Verify independently the effectiveness of configuration and     settings.</p> </li>

Suppose an application does not implement automated threat or credential stuffing protection. In that case, the application can be used as a password oracle to determine if the credentials are valid.</p> <p>Scenario #2: Most authentication attacks occur due to the continued use of passwords as a sole factor. Once considered, best practices, password rotation, and complexity requirements encourage users to use and reuse weak passwords. Organizations are recommended to stop these practices per NIST 800-63 and use multi-factor authentication.</p> <p>Scenario #3: Application session timeouts aren't set correctly. A user uses a public computer to access an application. Instead of selecting \"logout,\" the user simply closes the browser tab and walks away. An attacker uses the same browser an hour later, and the user is still authenticated.</p>"},{"location":"ja/A07_2021-Identification_and_Authentication_Failures/#references","title":"References","text":"<ul> <li> <p>OWASP Proactive Controls: Implement Digital

are three primary sources of data. We identify them as Human-assisted Tooling (HaT), Tool-assisted Human (TaH), and raw Tooling.</p> <p>Tooling and HaT are high-frequency finding generators. Tools will look for specific vulnerabilities and tirelessly attempt to find every instance of that vulnerability and will generate high finding counts for some vulnerability types. Look at Cross-Site Scripting, which is typically one of two flavors: it's either a more minor, isolated mistake or a systemic issue. When it's a systemic issue, the finding counts can be in the thousands for an application. This high frequency drowns out most other vulnerabilities found in reports or data.</p> <p>TaH, on the other hand, will find a broader range of vulnerability types but at a much lower frequency due to time constraints. When humans test an application and see something like Cross-Site Scripting, they will typically find three or four instances and stop. They can determine a systemic finding and write it up with a recommendation to fix on an application-wide scale. There is no need (or time) to find every instance.</p> <p>Suppose we take these two distinct data sets and try to merge them on frequency. In that case, the Tooling and HaT data will drown the more accurate (but broad) TaH data and is a good part of why something like Cross-Site Scripting has been so highly ranked in many lists when the impact is generally low to moderate. It's because of the sheer volume of findings. (Cross-Site Scripting is also reasonably easy to test for, so there are many more tests for it as well).</p> <p>In 2017, we introduced using incidence rate instead to take a fresh look at the data and cleanly merge Tooling and HaT data with TaH data. The incidence rate asks what percentage of the application population had at least one instance of a vulnerability type. We don't care if it was one-off or systemic. That's irrelevant for our purposes; we just need to know how many applications had at least one instance, which helps provide a clearer view of the testing is findings across multiple testing types without drowning the data in high-frequency results.</p>"},{"location":"zh-Hant/#what-is-your-data-collection-and-analysis-process","title":"What is your data collection and analysis process?","text":"<p>We formalized the OWASP Top 10 data collection process at the Open Security Summit in 2017.

We work with organizations as needed to help figure out the structure and mapping to CWEs.</p> <p>We get data from organizations that are testing vendors by trade, bug bounty vendors, and organizations that contribute internal testing data. Once we have the data, we load it together and run a fundamental analysis of what CWEs map to risk categories. There is overlap between some CWEs, and others are very closely related (ex. Cryptographic vulnerabilities). Any decisions related to the raw data submitted are documented and published to be open and transparent with how we normalized the data.</p> <p>We look at the eight categories with the highest incidence rates for inclusion in the Top 10.

Looking at the 2021     data, it became even more evident that XSS needed to move into     Injection.</p> </li> <li> <p>The overlap is only in one direction. We will often classify a     vulnerability by the end manifestation or \"symptom,\" not the     (potentially deep) root cause. For instance, \"Sensitive Data     Exposure\" may have been the result of a \"Security Misconfiguration\";     however, you won't see it in the other direction. As a result,     arrows are drawn in the interaction zones to indicate which     direction it occurs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sometimes these diagrams are drawn with everything in A06:2021     Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities.

are three primary sources of data. We identify them as Human-assisted Tooling (HaT), Tool-assisted Human (TaH), and raw Tooling.</p> <p>Tooling and HaT are high-frequency finding generators. Tools will look for specific vulnerabilities and tirelessly attempt to find every instance of that vulnerability and will generate high finding counts for some vulnerability types. Look at Cross-Site Scripting, which is typically one of two flavors: it's either a more minor, isolated mistake or a systemic issue. When it's a systemic issue, the finding counts can be in the thousands for an application. This high frequency drowns out most other vulnerabilities found in reports or data.</p> <p>TaH, on the other hand, will find a broader range of vulnerability types but at a much lower frequency due to time constraints. When humans test an application and see something like Cross-Site Scripting, they will typically find three or four instances and stop. They can determine a systemic finding and write it up with a recommendation to fix on an application-wide scale. There is no need (or time) to find every instance.</p> <p>Suppose we take these two distinct data sets and try to merge them on frequency. In that case, the Tooling and HaT data will drown the more accurate (but broad) TaH data and is a good part of why something like Cross-Site Scripting has been so highly ranked in many lists when the impact is generally low to moderate. It's because of the sheer volume of findings. (Cross-Site Scripting is also reasonably easy to test for, so there are many more tests for it as well).</p> <p>In 2017, we introduced using incidence rate instead to take a fresh look at the data and cleanly merge Tooling and HaT data with TaH data. The incidence rate asks what percentage of the application population had at least one instance of a vulnerability type. We don't care if it was one-off or systemic. That's irrelevant for our purposes; we just need to know how many applications had at least one instance, which helps provide a clearer view of the testing is findings across multiple testing types without drowning the data in high-frequency results.</p>"},{"location":"zh-Hant/A00_2021_Introduction/#what-is-your-data-collection-and-analysis-process","title":"What is your data collection and analysis process?","text":"<p>We formalized the OWASP Top 10 data collection process at the Open Security Summit in 2017.

We work with organizations as needed to help figure out the structure and mapping to CWEs.</p> <p>We get data from organizations that are testing vendors by trade, bug bounty vendors, and organizations that contribute internal testing data. Once we have the data, we load it together and run a fundamental analysis of what CWEs map to risk categories. There is overlap between some CWEs, and others are very closely related (ex. Cryptographic vulnerabilities). Any decisions related to the raw data submitted are documented and published to be open and transparent with how we normalized the data.</p> <p>We look at the eight categories with the highest incidence rates for inclusion in the Top 10. We also look at the industry survey results to see which ones may already be present in the data. The top two votes that aren't already present in the data will be selected for the other two places in the Top 10. Once all ten were selected, we applied generalized factors for exploitability and impact; to help rank the Top 10 in order.</p>"},{"location":"zh-Hant/A00_2021_Introduction/#data-factors","title":"Data Factors","text":"<p>There are data factors that are listed for each of the Top 10 Categories, here is what they mean:</p> <ul> <li> <p>CWEs Mapped: The number of CWEs mapped to a category by the Top 10   team.</p> </li> <li> <p>Incidence Rate: Incidence rate is the percentage of applications   vulnerable to that CWE from the population tested by that org for   that year.</p> </li> <li> <p>(Testing) Coverage: The percentage of applications tested by all   organizations for a given CWE.</p> </li> <li> <p>Weighted Exploit: The Exploit sub-score from CVSSv2 and CVSSv3   scores assigned to CVEs mapped to CWEs, normalized, and placed on a   10pt scale.</p> </li> <li> <p>Weighted Impact: The Impact sub-score from CVSSv2 and CVSSv3   scores assigned to CVEs mapped to CWEs, normalized, and placed on a   10pt scale.</p> </li> <li> <p>Total Occurrences: Total number of applications found to have the   CWEs mapped to a category.</p> </li> <li> <p>Total CVEs: Total number of CVEs in the NVD DB that were mapped to   the CWEs mapped to a category.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"zh-Hant/A00_2021_Introduction/#category-relationships-from-2017","title":"Category Relationships from 2017","text":"<p>There has been a lot of talk about the overlap between the Top Ten risks. By the definition of each (list of CWEs included), there really isn't any overlap. However, conceptually, there can be overlap or interactions based on the higher-level naming. Venn diagrams are many times used to show overlap like this.</p> <p></p> <p>The Venn diagram above represents the interactions between the Top Ten 2017 risk categories. While doing so, a couple of essential points became obvious:</p> <ol> <li> <p>One could argue that Cross-Site Scripting ultimately belongs within     Injection as it's essentially Content Injection. Looking at the 2021     data, it became even more evident that XSS needed to move into     Injection.</p> </li> <li> <p>The overlap is only in one direction. We will often classify a     vulnerability by the end manifestation or \"symptom,\" not the     (potentially deep) root cause. For instance, \"Sensitive Data     Exposure\" may have been the result of a \"Security Misconfiguration\";     however, you won't see it in the other direction. As a result,     arrows are drawn in the interaction zones to indicate which     direction it occurs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sometimes these diagrams are drawn with everything in A06:2021     Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities. While some of these     risk categories may be the root cause of third-party     vulnerabilities, they are generally managed differently and with     different responsibilities. The other types are typically     representing first-party risks.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"zh-Hant/A00_2021_Introduction/#thank-you-to-our-data-contributors","title":"Thank you to our data contributors","text":"<p>The following organizations (along with some anonymous donors) kindly donated data for over 500,000 applications to make this the largest and most comprehensive application security data set.

are three primary sources of data. We identify them as Human-assisted Tooling (HaT), Tool-assisted Human (TaH), and raw Tooling.</p> <p>Tooling and HaT are high-frequency finding generators. Tools will look for specific vulnerabilities and tirelessly attempt to find every instance of that vulnerability and will generate high finding counts for some vulnerability types. Look at Cross-Site Scripting, which is typically one of two flavors: it's either a more minor, isolated mistake or a systemic issue. When it's a systemic issue, the finding counts can be in the thousands for an application. This high frequency drowns out most other vulnerabilities found in reports or data.</p> <p>TaH, on the other hand, will find a broader range of vulnerability types but at a much lower frequency due to time constraints. When humans test an application and see something like Cross-Site Scripting, they will typically find three or four instances and stop. They can determine a systemic finding and write it up with a recommendation to fix on an application-wide scale. There is no need (or time) to find every instance.</p> <p>Suppose we take these two distinct data sets and try to merge them on frequency. In that case, the Tooling and HaT data will drown the more accurate (but broad) TaH data and is a good part of why something like Cross-Site Scripting has been so highly ranked in many lists when the impact is generally low to moderate. It's because of the sheer volume of findings. (Cross-Site Scripting is also reasonably easy to test for, so there are many more tests for it as well).</p> <p>In 2017, we introduced using incidence rate instead to take a fresh look at the data and cleanly merge Tooling and HaT data with TaH data. The incidence rate asks what percentage of the application population had at least one instance of a vulnerability type. We don't care if it was one-off or systemic. That's irrelevant for our purposes; we just need to know how many applications had at least one instance, which helps provide a clearer view of the testing is findings across multiple testing types without drowning the data in high-frequency results.</p>"},{"location":"zh-TW/#what-is-your-data-collection-and-analysis-process","title":"What is your data collection and analysis process?","text":"<p>We formalized the OWASP Top 10 data collection process at the Open Security Summit in 2017.

Once we have the data, we load it together and run a fundamental analysis of what CWEs map to risk categories. There is overlap between some CWEs, and others are very closely related (ex. Cryptographic vulnerabilities).

While doing so, a couple of essential points became obvious:</p> <ol> <li> <p>One could argue that Cross-Site Scripting ultimately belongs within     Injection as it's essentially Content Injection.

We will often classify a     vulnerability by the end manifestation or \"symptom,\" not the     (potentially deep) root cause.

OWASP SAMM can help you build and measure improvements in your software assurance efforts.</p>"},{"location":"zh-TW/A00_2021-How_to_start_an_AppSec_program_with_the_OWASP_Top_10/#stage-2-plan-for-a-paved-road-secure-development-lifecycle","title":"Stage 2.

The paved road aims to continuously improve, measure, detect and replace insecure alternatives by having an enterprise-wide library of drop-in secured replacements, with tooling to help see where improvements can be made by adopting the paved road. This allows existing development tools to report on insecure builds and help development teams self-correct away from insecure alternatives.</p> <p>The paved road might seem a lot to take in, but it should be built incrementally over time.

The more of these secure drop-in replacements provided to teams, the better. A vital task of the appsec team is to ensure that the security of these components is continuously evaluated and improved.

Tools will look for specific vulnerabilities and tirelessly attempt to find every instance of that vulnerability and will generate high finding counts for some vulnerability types. Look at Cross-Site Scripting, which is typically one of two flavors: it's either a more minor, isolated mistake or a systemic issue. When it's a systemic issue, the finding counts can be in the thousands for an application. This high frequency drowns out most other vulnerabilities found in reports or data. TaH, on the other hand, will find a broader range of vulnerability types but at a much lower frequency due to time constraints. When humans test an application and see something like Cross-Site Scripting, they will typically find three or four instances and stop. They can determine a systemic finding and write it up with a recommendation to fix on an application-wide scale. There is no need (or time) to find every instance.</p> <p>Suppose we take these two distinct data sets and try to merge them on frequency. In that case, the Tooling and HaT data will drown the more accurate (but broad) TaH data and is a good part of why something like Cross-Site Scripting has been so highly ranked in many lists when the impact is generally low to moderate. It's because of the sheer volume of findings. (Cross-Site Scripting is also reasonably easy to test for, so there are many more tests for it as well). In 2017, we introduced using incidence rate instead to take a fresh look at the data and cleanly merge Tooling and HaT data with TaH data. The incidence rate asks what percentage of the application population had at least one instance of a vulnerability type. We don't care if it was one-off or systemic. That's irrelevant for our purposes; we just need to know how many applications had at least one instance, which helps provide a clearer view of the testing is findings across multiple testing types without drowning the data in high-frequency results.</p>"},{"location":"zh-TW/A00_2021_Introduction/#what-is-your-data-collection-and-analysis-process","title":"What is your data collection and analysis process?","text":"<p>We formalized the OWASP Top 10 data collection process at the Open Security Summit in 2017. OWASP Top 10 leaders and the community spent two days working out formalizing a transparent data collection process. The 2021 edition is the second time we have used this methodology. We publish a call for data through social media channels available to us, both project and OWASP. On the OWASP Project page, we list the data elements and structure we are looking for and how to submit them. In the GitHub project, we have example files that serve as templates. We work with organizations as needed to help figure out the structure and mapping to CWEs. We get data from organizations that are testing vendors by trade, bug bounty vendors, and organizations that contribute internal testing data. Once we have the data, we load it together and run a fundamental analysis of what CWEs map to risk categories. There is overlap between some CWEs, and others are very closely related (ex. Cryptographic vulnerabilities). Any decisions related to the raw data submitted are documented and published to be open and transparent with how we normalized the data.</p> <p>We look at the eight categories with the highest incidence rates for inclusion in the Top 10. We also look at the industry survey results to see which ones may already be present in the data. The top two votes that aren't already present in the data will be selected for the other two places in the Top 10. Once all ten were selected, we applied generalized factors for exploitability and impact; to help rank the Top 10 in order.</p>"},{"location":"zh-TW/A00_2021_Introduction/#category-relationships-from-2017","title":"Category Relationships from 2017","text":"<p>There has been a lot of talk about the overlap between the Top Ten risks. By the definition of each (list of CWEs included), there really isn't any overlap. However, conceptually, there can be overlap or interactions based on the higher-level naming. Venn diagrams are many times used to show overlap like this.</p> <p>The Venn diagram above represents the interactions between the Top Ten 2017 risk categories. While doing so, a couple of essential points became obvious:</p> <ol> <li>One could argue that Cross-Site Scripting ultimately belongs within Injection as it's essentially Content Injection. Looking at the 2021 data, it became even more evident that XSS needed to move into Injection.</li> <li>The overlap is only in one direction. We will often classify a vulnerability by the end manifestation or \"symptom,\" not the (potentially deep) root cause. For instance, \"Sensitive Data Exposure\" may have been the result of a \"Security Misconfiguration\"; however, you won't see it in the other direction. As a result, arrows are drawn in the interaction zones to indicate which direction it occurs.</li> <li>Sometimes these diagrams are drawn with everything in A06:2021 Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities. While some of these risk categories may be the root cause of third-party vulnerabilities, they are generally managed differently and with different responsibilities. The other types are typically representing first-party risks.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"zh-TW/A00_2021_Introduction/#thank-you-to-our-financial-supporters","title":"Thank you to our financial

An insecure CI/CD pipeline can introduce the potential for unauthorized access, malicious code, or system compromise.
