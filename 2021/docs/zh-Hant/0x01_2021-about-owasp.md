# 关于 OWASP

The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) is an open community dedicated to enabling organizations to develop, purchase, and maintain applications and APIs that can be trusted.

At OWASP, you'll find free and open:

- Application security tools and standards
- Cutting edge research
- Standard security controls and libraries
- Complete books on application security testing, secure code development, and secure code review
- Presentations and [videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/OWASPGLOBAL)
- [Cheat sheets](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/) on many common topics
- [Chapters meetings](https://owasp.org/chapters/)
- [Events, training, and conferences](https://owasp.org/events/).
- [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/g/owasp)

Learn more at: [https://owasp.org](https://owasp.org).

All OWASP tools, documents, videos, presentations, and chapters are free and open to anyone interested in improving application security.

We advocate approaching application security as a people, process, and technology problem, because the most effective approaches to application security require improvements in these areas.

OWASP is a new kind of organization. Our freedom from commercial pressures allows us to provide unbiased, practical, and cost-effective information about application security.

OWASP is not affiliated with any technology company, although we support the informed use of commercial security technology. OWASP produces many types of materials in a collaborative, transparent, and open way.

The OWASP Foundation is the non-profit entity that ensures the project's long-term success. Almost everyone associated with OWASP is a volunteer, including the OWASP board, chapter leaders, project leaders, and project members. We support innovative security research with grants and infrastructure.
