## Overview

A new category for 2021 focuses on risks related to design and
architectural flaws, with a call for more use of threat modeling, secure
design patterns, and reference architectures. Notable Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) include
*CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information*,
*CWE-256: Unprotected Storage of Credentials*, *CWE-501: Trust Boundary
Violation*, and *CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials*.

## Description

Insecure design is a broad category representing many different
weaknesses, expressed as “missing or ineffective control design.”
Missing insecure design is where a control is absent. For example,
imagine code that should be encrypting sensitive data, but there is no
method. Ineffective insecure design is where an attacker could realize a threat,
but insufficient domain (business) logic validation prevents the action.
For example, imagine domain logic that is supposed to process pandemic
tax relief based upon income brackets but does not validate that all
inputs are correctly signed and provides a much more significant relief
benefit than should be granted.

### Requirements and Resource Management

Collect and negotiate the business requirements for an application with the
business, including the protection requirements concerning confidentiality,
authenticity, integrity, availability of all data assets, and the expected
business logic. Take into account how exposed your application will be and
if you need segregation of tenants (additionally to access control). Compile
the technical requirements, including functional and non-functional security
requirements. Plan and negotiate the budget covering all design, build,
testing, and operation, including security activities.

### Secure Design

Secure design is a culture and methodology that constantly evaluates
threats and ensures that code is robustly designed and tested to prevent
known attack methods. Learn from mistakes and offer positive incentives to promote improvements. Secure design is neither an add-on nor a tool that you can add to software.

### Secure Development Lifecycle

Secure software requires a secure development lifecycle, some form of secure 
design pattern or paved road componentlibrary or tooling, and threat modeling. 
Reach out for your security specialists at the beginning of a software project
throughout the whole project and maintenance of your software.

## How to Prevent

-   Establish and use a secure development lifecycle with AppSec
    professionals to help evaluate and design security and
    privacy-related controls

-   Establish and use a library of secure design patterns or paved road
    ready to use components

-   Use threat modeling for critical authentication, access control,
    business logic, and key flows

-   Integrate plausibility checks at each tier of your application
    (from frontend to backend)

-   Write unit and integration tests to validate that all critical flows 
    are resistant to the threat model. Compile use-cases *and* misuse-cases
    for each tier of your application.

-   Segregate tier layers on the system and network layers depending on the
    exposure and protection needs

-   Segregate tenants robustly by design throughout all tiers

-   Limit resource consumption by user or service

## Example Attack Scenarios

**Scenario #1:** A credential recovery workflow might include “questions
and answers,” which is prohibited by NIST 800-63b, the OWASP ASVS, and
the OWASP Top 10. Questions and answers cannot be trusted as evidence of
identity as more than one person can know the answers, which is why they
are prohibited. Such code should be removed and replaced with a more
secure design.

**Scenario #2:** A cinema chain allows group booking discounts and has a
maximum of fifteen attendees before requiring a deposit. Attackers could
threat model this flow and test if they could book six hundred seats and
all cinemas at once in a few requests, causing a massive loss of income.

**Scenario #3:** A retail chain’s e-commerce website does not have
protection against bots run by scalpers buying high-end video cards to
resell auction websites. This creates terrible publicity for the video
card makers and retail chain owners and enduring bad blood with
enthusiasts who cannot obtain these cards at any price. Careful anti-bot
design and domain logic rules, such as purchases made within a few
seconds of availability, might identify inauthentic purchases and
rejected such transactions.
