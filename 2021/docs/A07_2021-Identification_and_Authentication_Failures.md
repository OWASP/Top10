## Overview

Previously known as *Broken Authentication*, this category slid down
from the second position and now includes CWEs related to identification
failures. Notable CWEs included are *CWE-297: Improper Validation of
Certificate with Host Mismatch*, *CWE-287: Improper Authentication*, and
*CWE-384: Session Fixation*.

## Description 

Confirmation of the user's identity, authentication, and session
management is critical to protect against authentication-related
attacks. There may be authentication weaknesses if the application:

-   Permits automated attacks such as credential stuffing, where the
    attacker has a list of valid usernames and passwords.

-   Permits brute force or other automated attacks.

-   Permits default, weak, or well-known passwords, such as "Password1"
    or "admin/admin. "

-   Uses weak or ineffective credential recovery and forgot-password
    processes, such as "knowledge-based answers," which cannot be made
    safe.

-   Uses plain text, encrypted, or weakly hashed passwords (see
    A3:2017-Sensitive Data Exposure).

-   Has missing or ineffective multi-factor authentication.

-   Exposes session identifier in the URL.

-   Reuse session identifier after successful login.

-   Does not correctly invalidate Session IDs. User sessions or
    authentication tokens (mainly single sign-on (SSO) tokens) aren't
    properly invalidated during logout or a period of inactivity.

## How to Prevent

-   Where possible, implement multi-factor authentication to prevent
    automated credential stuffing, brute force, and stolen credential
    reuse attacks.

-   Do not ship or deploy with any default credentials, particularly for
    admin users.

-   Implement weak password checks, such as testing new or changed
    passwords against the top 10,000 worst passwords list.

-   Align password length, complexity, and rotation policies with NIST
    800-63b's guidelines in section 5.1.1 for Memorized Secrets or other
    modern, evidence-based password policies.

-   Ensure registration, credential recovery, and API pathways are
    hardened against account enumeration attacks by using the same
    messages for all outcomes.

-   Limit or increasingly delay failed login attempts. Log all failures
    and alert administrators when credential stuffing, brute force, or
    other attacks are detected.

-   Use a server-side, secure, built-in session manager that generates a
    new random session ID with high entropy after login. Session identifier
    should not be in the URL, be securely stored, and invalidated after
    logout, idle, and absolute timeouts.

## Example Attack Scenarios

**Scenario #1:** Credential stuffing, the use of lists of known
passwords, is a common attack. Suppose an application does not implement
automated threat or credential stuffing protection. In that case, the
application can be used as a password oracle to determine if the
credentials are valid.

**Scenario #2:** Most authentication attacks occur due to the continued
use of passwords as a sole factor. Once considered, best practices,
password rotation, and complexity requirements encourage users to use
and reuse weak passwords. Organizations are recommended to stop these
practices per NIST 800-63 and use multi-factor authentication.

**Scenario #3:** Application session timeouts aren't set correctly. A
user uses a public computer to access an application. Instead of
selecting "logout," the user simply closes the browser tab and walks
away. An attacker uses the same browser an hour later, and the user is
still authenticated.
