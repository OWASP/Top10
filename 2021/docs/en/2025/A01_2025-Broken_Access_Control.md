#  A01:2025 Broken Access Control ![icon](../../assets/TOP_10_Icons_Final_Broken_Access_Control.png){: style="height:80px;width:80px" align="right"}



## Background. 

Maintaining its position at #1 in the Top Ten, 100% of the applications tested were found to have some form of broken access control. Notable CWEs included are *CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor*, *CWE-201: Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Sent Data*, *CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)*, and *CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)*. This category has the highest number of occurrences in the contributed data, and second highest number of related CVEs.

## Description. 

Access control enforces policy such that users cannot act outside of their intended permissions. Failures typically lead to unauthorized information disclosure, modification or destruction of all data, or performing a business function outside the user's limits. Common access control vulnerabilities include:



* Violation of the principle of least privilege, commonly known as deny by default, where access should only be granted for particular capabilities, roles, or users, but is available to anyone.
* Bypassing access control checks by modifying the URL (parameter tampering or force browsing), internal application state, or the HTML page, or by using an attack tool that modifies API requests.
* Permitting viewing or editing someone else's account by providing its unique identifier (insecure direct object references)
* An accessible API with missing access controls for POST, PUT, and DELETE.
* Elevation of privilege. Acting as a user without being logged in or or gaining privileges beyond those expected of the logged in user (e.g. admin access). 
* Metadata manipulation, such as replaying or tampering with a JSON Web Token (JWT) access control token, a cookie or hidden field manipulated to elevate privileges, or abusing JWT invalidation.
* CORS misconfiguration allows API access from unauthorized or untrusted origins.
* Force browsing (guessing URLs) to authenticated pages as an unauthenticated user or to privileged pages as a standard user.


## How to prevent. 

Access control is only effective when implemented in trusted server-side code or serverless APIs, where the attacker cannot modify the access control check or metadata.



* Except for public resources, deny by default.
* Implement access control mechanisms once and reuse them throughout the application, including minimizing Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) usage.
* Model access controls should enforce record ownership rather than allowing users to create, read, update, or delete any record.
* Unique application business limit requirements should be enforced by domain models.
* Disable web server directory listing and ensure file metadata (e.g., .git) and backup files are not present within web roots.
* Log access control failures, alert admins when appropriate (e.g., repeated failures).
* Implement rate limits on API and controller access to minimize the harm from automated attack tooling.
* Stateful session identifiers should be invalidated on the server after logout. Stateless JWT tokens should be short-lived to minimize the window of opportunity for an attacker. For longer-lived JWTs, it's highly recommended to follow the OAuth standards to revoke access.
* Use well-established toolkits or patterns that provide simple, declarative access controls.

Developers and QA staff should include functional access control in their unit and integration tests.


## Example attack scenarios. 

**Scenario #1:** The application uses unverified data in an SQL call that is accessing account information:


```
pstmt.setString(1, request.getParameter("acct"));
ResultSet results = pstmt.executeQuery( );
```


An attacker can simply modify the browser's 'acct' parameter to send any desired account number. If not correctly verified, the attacker can access any user's account.


```
https://example.com/app/accountInfo?acct=notmyacct
```


**Scenario #2:** An attacker simply forces browsers to target URLs. Admin rights are required for access to the admin page.


```
https://example.com/app/getappInfo
https://example.com/app/admin_getappInfo
```


If an unauthenticated user can access either page, it's a flaw. If a non-admin can access the admin page, this is a flaw.

**Scenario #3:** An application puts all of their access control in their front-end. While the attacker cannot get to `https://example.com/app/admin_getappInfo` due to JavaScript code running in the browser, they can simply execute:


```
$ curl https://example.com/app/admin_getappInfo
```


from the command line.
